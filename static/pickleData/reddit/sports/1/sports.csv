My knowledge of American sports is minimal but I am trying to come up with best analogies.   The major crazy things to happen  1. Trent Boult caught the ball  but stepped on the boundary line resulting in a six in the 49th over of the second innings - only 1% of the game was remaining (imagine a soccer goalkeeper catching the ball but stepping backward due to momentum of the ball resulting in a goal IN THE 89TH MINUTE)  2. Throw ~~over~~ from Guptill deflecting off Stokes' bat resulting in four extra runs (imagine a throw to the base from outfield hitting the runner on the helmet and deflecting somewhere in the field and they get an inside the park home run in the bottom of the ninth innings - not exactly but close enough for you to judge how important it was)  3. The match ended in a tie. Ties in cricket as rare as fuck unlike soccer or baseball. This was the fifth ever tie in a WC match and 38th overall (out of roughly 4000 all time). WC Final being tied is an even bigger deal.  4. Even the super over was a tie. Imagine the NBA Final seventh game going into extra time and the score is still level after extra time. The winner was decided by who hit more boundaries (Imagine the NBA being decided on who hit more three pointers in the seventh game).

Great captaincy by Kane Williamson the whole tournament  really fitting he was named as player of the tournament.   England playing at Lords in the final (historically not a lucky ground for us) vs a team so evenly matched that it took a super over (which ended tied) and the only thing that could split them was the number of boundaries scored. I know I personally am elated because I'm an Englishman  but I'm a cricket fan also and for me this was the best game of cricket I have ever watched.  Jos Buttler and Ben Stokes showing solid batting at a time when England were on the ropes - shoring up the innings and breathing hope into a shaky time and giving us a chance when it seemed very much like we could collapse. And then coming back to bat the super-over vs Trent Boult (the no. 2 ranked ODI bowler) and putting a good score up.     I feel like not enough credit is being given to Jofra Archer's composure and nerves of steel  he bowled a wide first ball (close but it WAS wide) but then bowling extremely well. That man is going to be a monster for the next 10 years for England if he continues to develop as he has so far.  &#x200B;  Don't dwell on the why's and the wherefores regarding freakish luck  these things happen in all sports  rules are rules and the umpires can only use the rules to decide the action.   &#x200B;  Ben Stokes knew he had been in a game today  he looked mentally and physically exhausted at the end  just so glad he managed to see it through.  &#x200B;  Great end to a great tournament  cricket truly was the winner.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.1475980392156863,85533,

Think football/soccer  you're 3-2 up with 1 minute to go. Opposition takes a shot  the keeper saves it  but the opposition loses a shoe and the ball bounces off the shoe and goes into the goal  resulting in a tie game.  The game goes to penalty shootout and both teams score 5 penalties each but the opposition wins it because they scored more goals from open play during normal time instead of freekicks/corners.  Sounds weird af  but the reality is even more complicated.  Long story short  winning team didn't do anything wrong  all within the rules of the game  they just got extremely lucky. Probably one of the luckiest wins of all time in all sports.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.07348484848484847,85534,

And all those events in England were all on free to air tv  all at the same time today... So i think its safe to say this has been the greatest day of sport in England's history. Unrivaled tbh. Unforgettable too. Its been an amazing day if your English especially.   And regarding the cricket: Well that was the best ODI match ive ever seen. It had everything. So engrossing. Yes it was rather jammy how England even made it to a super-over  what with Ben Stokes and his sliding bat as he slid to the crease and the ball hitting it sending it to the boundry(and if Ben Stokes had hit his shot better originally well England wouldve lost  so getting it wrong actually benefitted England today) etc.. but sometimes you get a bit of luck. Its sport for you. Anyhow it may not be football  but cricket sure came home today.. GET IN BABY!!🏆No.1.  PS. Like many English  i played cricket at school during P.E.(plus one of my teachers was actually a former cricket coach  plus we had cricket nets etc)... I really enjoyed it. Although i think its a sport that's much more fun to play than it is to watch(but having said that i remember the incredible 2005 Ashes series vs Australia  England on home soil etc.. it captivated the nation like no other sporting event since really. It really was that amazing. Shame really that cricket left free to air tv since then and interest has declined accordingly now its behind a paywall  the ruling body only ever cared about ££££  the long term health of the sport be damed  smh :/).

If England had won the toss at the start of the game they would have likely chosen to bat first (teams batting first in this world cup have been far more likely to win) and with the new ball swinging less in the morning they may have posted something more like 280 and it would have been an average game wrapped up quite easily.  I actually think it's quite contencious that new Zealand were even in the last 4 teams  in their last group game against England they batted 2nd and from quite early on in the innings they blocked and batted really slowly so as to try and bat out the whole 50 overs with the aim of keeping their average score up so that they got through ahead of the 5th place team  the commentary team were saying rules need to change because boring batting is not what one day cricket should be.  If this was played over anything more than 1 game at a slopey pitch where England don't play well having lost the toss  there would only be one winner  the better team won  I only feel sorry for NZ that it had to happen like it did.

England still had a chance to win  but weren't quite scoring runs fast enough  with every ball the required run rate for the remaining overs was getting higher.  By about the time of the 48th over it was clear  of all the many top level sports today  the most tense was the tennis. Deep in the final set tie-break  the opponents so evenly matched that it was looked likely it was going to end in the weird tie-break-ending rules. That is the moment I decided to stop trying to watch all the sport live by switching channels  and set the cricket to record.  At the end of that extraordinary tennis match  with my heart beating fast  I put on the playback of the cricket. The recording started mid 48th over with an NZ fielder tripping over a boundary line with e ball in his hands. On replay  it was shown that Stokes was nearly caught out at the boundary  but because the fielder had hit the boundary line  he got a 6 instead. A lucky reprieve for England  but by the start of the last over the run target looked too high.  Final over started with 2 balls for no runs. Then a 6. Then Stokes hit and ran for two  as he dived for safety from the run out the fielded ball deflected from his bat and rolled to the boundary  which under the laws of the game apparently counts and bought him up to the oddest 6 that anybody is ever likely to see.   Last ball of the match: England need 2 runs to win. Stokes hits  they attempt to run for 2  New Zealand get the wicket - run out. England have scored 1 run and tied the match.  Tie break: 'Super Over'. Each team has 1 over at bat to score as many runs as possible. Last team batting (England) are to bat first. Stokes is exhausted  but keyed in. No flukes in this over  but with a couple of boundaries they get 15 runs for the over  NZ need 16 to win.  A wide  a 6. By the penultimate ball NZ can win with a four. Last ball of the tie break and again it's   2 to win. Th rules have already been explained but NZ ask for confirmation- if the Super Over run scores are equal the final decider is total number of boundaries in the match; England have more. NZ get a total of 15 for over and the tie break is tied.   England wins  in the most tense sports match of the day.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.16266984715964308,85744,

Even Colin De Grandhomme (generally considered a 6th/7th bowler) is very effective in English conditions. They have a very fast bowler in Lockie Ferguson  and fast bowling has been very effective this World Cup. And finally they have a very accurate spin bowler who is good at not leaking many runs (perfect for pitches in England which aren't great for spin bowling  and so require someone that builds pressure through dot balls rather than trying to take wickets and going for runs in the process).

If the number of wickets did matter in deciding the winner  they wouldn't have lost so many (especially those in the last 2 balls).   The last ball... they definitely would not have risked that wicket. And speaking of wickets.. NZ would have not risked that superover wicket if they knew wickets mattered.

Djokovic  Federer  Nadal are all still incredible because of their fitness levels and determination  hence why they’ve been relevant for so long (especially Federer and Nadal  but djokovic isn’t that much younger — I can see him playing just as well for at least another 5 years given his insane work ethic and fitness). There are a ton of insanely talented young players — Dominic Theim  Stefanos Tsitispas  and Alexander Zverev in particular come to mind. Tsitispas beat Federer at the Australian open this year  and he’s only 20. They are the three of the most likely to dethrone these older guys when they get consistency and mental toughness.   Federer had a bit of a dip for a few years — he didn’t win any GS titles between Wimbledon 2009 and Wimbledon 2012  and then another dip until he had a great 2017. Still  Federer retained his cult following despite these dips because he plays a beautiful style of tennis and is so well known in the sport. Even during that ‘dip’  he was still a huge competitor to face in the big tournaments.   I think Federer is always making news headlines is because he is pushing 40 and still killing it which was formerly unheard of in tennis  so anything he does is impressive as fuck. Also  since he’s a huge fan favourite  he always makes sports headlines because his name/face are recognizable and he’s popular. There have been tons of long  incredible  impressive matches that don’t get as much attention if he’s not playing in it  which kind of makes sense even if it isn’t entirely fair. Tsitispas and Wawrinka played an insane 5-set thriller at the French Open this year  but it wasn’t as talked about because neither of those guys are in the big three.   As for ‘god mode’  I wouldn’t go that far. I think he’s just really fit  determined  genuinely love playing tennis  and wants to keep breaking records. Actually  I think he is a lot more human than Djokovic and Nadal  because it seems like he cracks mentally more than the other two.   This is all just my opinion  but as an avid tennis watcher for years  I don’t think there is a shortage of great players and I don’t think  Federer is on god mode. I think it’s a combination of federer’s fitness and popularity that keeps him relevant more than anything  and these big three guys set the standard for up and coming players. It’s mentally a huge hurdle to beat these guys  in addition to their great tennis abilities.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.2378654970760234,86151,

In the most important parts of the match  Djokovic was stronger. That’s why he won.   Also  Federer didn’t win “wayyyy” more games. He won a few more  because of the 2nd set. He lost the tie breaks.   I wouldn’t change a thing about tennis scoring - it is unique and exciting.  And I would argue that he didn’t play better overall. Any time there were pivotal moments  he broke down. That is not playing better overall. You can’t be a champion and only perform your best when things are going smoothly.

Where experience and mental strength means a lot  which it does in individual sports like tennis  having 10+ years under your belt can also mean a lot. younger players shit their pants too often and are nowhere near as stoic as the big three,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",-0.009374999999999994,86359,

Nadal is absolutely dominant on clay  but is still a great player on other surfaces as well. He has 6 other grand slams outside of Roland Garros. He’s one of 8 players with a career slam. He’s second all time only to Federer in total slams. It’s conceivable that Nadal will end up with more French Open wins than any player has total slams outside Novak and Roger  which is insane.  Considering his injuries that have potentially cost him the chance to have a couple more slams by now  the highest win percentage of any player in the open era  being only 2 slams behind Federer but a full 4 years younger  2 ahead of Djokovic only being 1 year older  a 24-16 record vs Federer and ~~an 18-16 record vs Djokovic~~  he has a claim and it’s a legitimate argument. Do I think Nadal is the GOAT? No. I don’t. I think it’s Roger. But do I think he can make an argument that holds some weight? Hell yeah I do. All 3 of them can.  Edit: Error in the record claim.

Find me a single sport  international (ie representative) competition that's bigger than them.  > Rugby likely has a smaller world fanbase than all of the sports I listed above (the sports popularity ranking will vary a bit by source  but I don't ever see rugby listed as a top 5 sport).  We could argue until the cows came home about the order of sports (personally I reckon football  clear water  followed by cricket  rugby  and basketball in a huddle together)  but there's the simple matter that none of those sports have world cups anywhere near the same size (in terms of crowd  broadcast reach and viewing figures) of Rugby's.   >What countries even play all three of those sports competitively?  That's sort of the point mate. No other country has won all three of the biggest world cups. Those three world cups are the largest world cups by any sensible measure.  > They are the top 3 team sports in the country that have big international competitions  so why not?  Because the Ice Hockey/Basketball/Baseball world cups are nowhere near the same size or importance as Rugby/Cricket/Football  If we just use average attendance at the last World Cup for each of the above:  Rugby: 51 621  Football: 47 371  Baseball (held across multiple continents to maximise attendance): 27 168  Cricket (2015): 20 743  Basketball: 8 489  Ice Hockey: 8 133  There's a pretty clear top two  and on viewing figures cricket easily beats out the Baseball classic.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.09596560846560848,86754,

Rugby Union is most certainly not a top 3 world sport in terms of popularity  it may have been at one point  but is certainly not now.

The US finally won their first championship after putting out their best roster to date especially in terms of batters but they still didn’t have guys like Clayton Kershaw  Max Scherzer  and Mike Trout  literally the best player in baseball.   I didn’t pay attention to the first two tournaments but I’m pretty sure Japan took it much more seriously at first than the US and other countries and put up stronger rosters despite a worse pool of players to choose from leading to their two championships.   The biggest issue is that it takes place in March prior to the MLB regular season so it’s really tough to get good pitchers to participate. They can’t go deep into games that early in the year and don’t want to risk an injury prior to the season.   Slightly off topic but some of the teams in the World Baseball Classic are just Americans who weren’t good enough to make the US team. Like Team Italy was just a bunch of Americans with Italian grandparents and Team Israel was just Jewish Americans. It kind of sucks for other countries  actually trying to compete who couldn’t qualify. They should really limit it to just your parents rather than grandparents for representing a country. Puerto Rico also competes separately from the US too for some reason and they’re both usually top teams in the tournament.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.20964052287581694,86812,

There are actually  very strong and vibrant Rugby competitions across Asia  including China  Japan  India  Thailand etc  but they do not play internationally  except Japan  as the growth and development in those countries has not been to the level required to play other nations. Also  do not mistake Rugby Union with that other game Rugby League. They are entirely different games and only one uses handbags and make-up :)  On a side note  Argentina is a powerhouse in Rugby  however up until after the 2007 RWC did not play other nations outside of RWC. The internal Rugby skill and support has to reach a certain level before the can even take the field against another nation  hence the term ""Test match"". They will be shite to begin with  but will eventually be competitive  as the US is proving these days.  The reason Americans didn't know CWC was on is because you weren't in it. Given the sheer population of your country  the existing cricket population could produce a competitive team  but it takes skill and unfortunately  money  to play on the world stage.

It was formed in 1999 to promote  develop  organise and administer the game of rugby in Europe under the authority of World Rugby (the world governing body of rugby union).  The predecessor to Rugby Europe was the Fédération Internationale de Rugby Amateur (FIRA) which was established in 1934 to administer rugby union in Europe outside the authority of the International Rugby Football Board (as World Rugby was then called)  and quickly came to spread outside the continent. FIRA agreed to come under the auspices of World Rugby in the 1990s and appended 'Association Européenne de Rugby' to its name in a return to being a European body.  ***  ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/sports/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",-0.04523809523809525,86881,

Firstly there is no dedicated pit crew in formula 1 like other motor sports have. The pit crew are the normal mechanics who have built the car and who have to rebuild the car in a hurry whenever the drivers crashes. And the worst that can happen if you mess up the pitstop is not that the car may be broken but that anyone gets injured or killed. It is dangerous to be out in the pit lane during a race and not uncommon for some members of a pit crew to get sent to hospital each year. For example last year a mechanic broke his foot because of a stuck wheel nut. There were also several cases of wheels falling off a car after a pitstop so that wheels and cars were flying uncontrollably down the pitlane where other pit crews were standing. If the car is not stabelized properly then it makes the life dificult for the wheel changers which can cause someone to loose their life. And lastly the job of the stabelizers is not only to stabelize the car but also to clean the car as rubber and dirt may increase drag. They may also have to adjust things on the car if the driver have issues with the setup.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",-0.11776418026418024,86922,

(Women are three). First to win 3 sets wins the match (two sets for women) Each set is decided by being the first player to win 6 games but only if you are up by two upon winning the 6th game. So a score of 6 games to 4 would award that set to the person with 6 games. However  if the scoreline is 5-5 in the set  and someone wins a game  then it is 6-5 and another game must be played. If the person with 6 wins that next game  then it's 7-5 and they've won the set. If they don't win  then it's 6-6  and the set goes to a tiebreak. Tiebreaks are like a mini set with the objective being to score 7 points and be up by a margin of two. Also in a tibreak  the first person to serve gets to serve only the first point then the other party gets to serve the next two points  before the service returns to the first player. For the remainder of the tiebreak  every two points the serve switches back and forth between players until one player gets to 7 points  or if they are still even at that point  until one player establishes a two point lead. The set then concludes at a 7-6 game scoreline. This is what happened in the first and 3rd sets of Djokavic v Federer!  The 5th and deciding set is special and can have different outcomes depending on the specific tournament rules. At Wimbeldon  the win by two games rule to claim the set extends until a scoreline of 12-12 games is reached (assuming no player has established a two game lead by that point. Plenty of 5th sets end with scores like 6-3 or 7-5 for example). At 12-12 a final tiebreak game happens to determine the winner of the whole match. (Some tournaments don't have a 5th set tie break at all so you have to win by two games no matter how long it takes  others have a 5th set tiebreak at the same scoreline as a regular set at 6-6  just depends on the tourney) The 5th set went all the way to a tiebreak in the Wimbeldon finals too  with Djokavic winning the tiebreaker 25th game of the 5th set to win it 13-12  claiming his 3rd set overall and thus winning the match 3 sets to 2 sets. This tiebreak 5th set outcome almost never happens  so we were all extremely lucky to have witnessed it between two of the best to ever play the game!,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.1428824721377913,86970,

An innings consists of everyone on a team batting until they are out. Then switching over and the other team bats. Imagine a baseball team doing all their batting innings in one block and then switching over to field for the rest of the game.  Each team gets 11 batsmen however there must always be two left to continue play. Once the 10 batsmen are out  the score they get to is the teams final score. The other team have to get beyond this total to win the game before their own 10 batsmen get out.   The batsmen defends the wooden stumps which the bowler tries to take out. If they are  then the batsmen is immediately out and cannot return.  Runs are scored by running between the two sets of stumps which counts as one run. Both batsmen have to swap sides for a run to be scored. You can do this as many times as you want but you run the risk of being 'run out' (See below).  If the ball is hit over or touches the boundary line which runs 360° around the edge of the field you get automatic runs and the batsmen don't have to run between the stumps. If the ball bounces infield first  you get 4 runs. But if it doesn't (like a home run) then you get 6 runs.  An 'Over' - Bowler gets six attempts at the batsmen. After this six  the fielding team switches ends (not the batsmen) and another bowler gets six attempts. Bowlers specialise in different styles of bowling. (Spin bowling: https://youtu.be/eZyQQl_YYRM & Swing bowling: https://youtu.be/iboakCXwvgw)  Four ways to be out -   1: The bowler hits the stumps from his bowl.  2: The ball is hit and somebody on the fielding team catches it (same as baseball).  3: Run out & Stumped - Similar to baseball. If the batsmen are not in their crease (on their base)  which is the white lines in the above video around the wooden stumps  then the fielders can get them out by hitting the wooden stumps before the batsmen get to them. (https://youtu.be/ilyWOLGo6zA)  4: LBW. It means 'leg before wicket'. Basically you can only stop the ball from hitting the stumps with your bat. If you do it with your legs then it's LBW. Umpire has to decide on whether it would or not.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.01153846153846154,86979,

Each innings has its own column  NZ's batting innings on the left. You can see the team total of 241/8  meaning the Kiwis team scored 241 runs  with a total of 8 outs.   Below this the team's highest scoring batsmen. Nicholls top scored for NZ with 55 runs. In the other column  an interesting distinction  you can see that Stokes scored 84 runs off 98 balls. The asterisk beside it shows that he was not out at the end of the game. That magnificent bastard top scored in a world cup final  and nobody could manage to get him out. Epic.  Below them  are the stats for the best English bowlers from the innings. Woakes  for instance got 3 wickets  gave away 37 runs  and bowled 9 overs out of his maximum 10.

It just takes concentration. If you’re actually fast  you run this race and let the rest of your teammates argue over who has to run the other shitty events.   200m. You go all out and get smacked with some pretty shitty lactic acid at the end. It hurts.   400m. This is the longest sprint where your heel doesn’t touch the ground. Your legs give up with about 1/3 of the race left and you have to run on your burning toes to the finish line. I threw up every time I ran this race in college (9). It’s a special kind of hell.   800m is a mind fuck. You’ve got to get after it in the first lap and go back and do it again the second time. It’s terrifying.   1600 and up.

I put these in quotes because they are relative and a miler or marathoner would laugh at the idea of a 400 being anywhere close to a distance race. While a sprinter often considers a 400 to be hell. It requires training of both the anaerobic and aerobic systems.  There is more strategy than going as fast as you can for 45 seconds because the body is not able to do so. So in a way  you are pushing your body to do something that doesn't make sense. It's a game of who can slow down the least. Even 100m sprinters are already decelerating after 60-70 meters.

A no hitter is when a side holds their opponents to no hits throughout the game. In the game 27 outs have to be recorded in groups of 3. Outs come from a) batters being caught out or thrown out when the ball is put in play off their bat  or b) struck out - unlike cricket  well placed balls passing the batter  or batsman’s swings count against him (3 well placed balls/swings*). So normal games average 146 pitches per side... a no hitter says that no batter was able to use any of those potential 146 pitches to put the ball in play past defenders to become a runner or out of the playing field for a run.   It’s a rare occurrence - 301 have been thrown since the late 1870s.  Modern seasons have 162 games / team plus any post season tournament playoffs. This is over 2400 games in a season x 2 sides per game or over 4800 opportunities for a no hitter in a game by either side.  They happen usually < 10 times per season or in around .2% of games or less.  \* particularly simplifying here - a batter gets ‘3 strikes and they’re out’,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",-0.03823529411764707,87588,

But  my comment was a joking reference to the movie Angels In The Outfield. For those unfamiliar with the plot  a foster child's biological father tells him they'll be a family again ""when the Angels win the Pennant""  in a very sarcastic and assbaggy way. Nevertheless this gives the child hope  and soon enough he starts seeing real angels on the field  who ultimately help the team play better and win games.  It's a fun kids movie from the 90s.  I agree  the Angels are only 5.5 out of the wildcard and teams DO sometimes seem to get an emotional boost from tragedy.  See: 2013 Red Sox  2017-18 Golden Knights.

An out is when a fielder catches the ball thrown from another fielder while touching first base  which is the spot a batter must run to after contacting the ball  or a fielder catches a ball before it touches the ground. (Think run out and caught in cricket.

An out can be as simple as the ball being caught in the air without touching the ground. Or thrown to first base before the batter/runner reaches the base.

That's because by then the batters have usually seen everything the pitcher has to offer and begin timing him really well  a long with the pitcher starting to tire. Also  teams usually have their best hitters at the top of the lineup to give them the most at bats possible. This is why you often see pitchers struggle these days to get past the 5th or 6th inning.  So to counteract this teams have started to use an opener to pitch the first inning or two against the best hitters in the opposing lineup. If everything goes well  your opener has pitched 2 innings and the main guy can come in facing the weakest part of the lineup  the 7th-9th hitters. He can now go through the line up twice where the matchup is better  and by the time he starts getting through the lineup a 3rd time he again goes up against the weakest hitters. The pitchers team can see if they can squeeze one more inning out of the main guy against the 7-9 hitters before bringing in another reliever to finish the game.  This game was kind of an ideal example of that. The opener gets through the 1-6 hitters in two innings and then the main guy can carry it seven more innings while only facing the 1-6 hitters twice and facing the 7-9 hitters three times. If there's any road bumps in there you bring in a reliever to pitch that last inning. If your main pitcher for the game is only going to go 5-7 innings you might as well have him go up against the weaker hitters as often possible and minimize the pitchers exposure to the best hitters giving your pitchers the best odds overall. It's a good way to squeeze out a tiny edges over a long 162 game season. And those little extra advantages add up over the course of a full season to a few extra wins. If you don't have a top of the line starter throwing that day  you can get an extra inning or two out of a normally mediocre starter.  And by giving your main pitcher for the game a slight lineup advantage  you can actually save your bullpen some wear and tear over the course of a full season. If starters start struggling in the 5th you'll usually need to bring in 3 or 4 relievers to finish the game. Not to mention by the time a traditional starter starts struggling you might all of a sudden have runners on base with the best part of the lineup hitting. This means bringing in a reliever in high pressure situations  which is not good. But if you do the opener strategy and you can now get your main pitcher to go 6 or 7 innings you've now dropped your pitchers used in a game from 4 or 5 under the traditional manner to 3 or 4.  That gives your bullpen extra rest that really adds up over 162 games. Also  by using the opener and having that slight advantage  you can more often pull the main pitcher out between innings and have your reliever come in with the bases empty against that top part of the lineup which makes it less likely they'll score a run.

Throughout the year  in any open event you play in  you will ""score"" ranking points based on what round you went out in (or if you won). These points are then used to calculate rankings.  The points work on a 12-month cycle. i.e. the points you got for a tournament last year will be replaced with the points from this year. Also  if you don't play a tournament then you don't get any points for it. So if you played a tournament last year and didn't this year  then you will lose all of those points from your total.  So the reason ""#7 beating #11"" is still an upset is because the world rankings are not necessarily representative of the talent of the players. And  in this case  Serena is ranked number 11 because she hasn't been playing many tournaments this year (despite being in every grand slam final of the last 12 months).",,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.08,87746,

Novak used to be a whiny little bastard on the court. Constantly crying to his box I used to not be able to stand him. He’s improved. Rafa you’re probably right he’s a machine and has been for a long time  but I’m sure in his youth he sent some racquets to their graves.  And he’s gotten into it with opponents a lil back n forth. Shit Peyton Manning is a nice dude and him going ballistic on his offensive line is on YouTube. Mj punched Steve Kerr. Ron Artest beat up fans. To be a pro you have to be insanely competitive. It’s the nature of the beast. Serena’s not an outlier she’s the standard.  I watced a lot of sports and tennis is pretty prissy compared to other sports but she in no way is worse than what I’ve seen 100s of times from fantastic athletes. If anything I understand. I wanted to Toss my back in the lake today and would have if I was rich.  Maybe there are a lot of people on reddit who haven’t played serious competitive sports or aren’t competitive in general but I see your argument a lot and it doesn’t hold water vs the reality of competition.

No question. Nadal is #2 and nobody will ever dominate clay line he has. I think Nadal could pass Roger in majors. I mean Rafa is gonna be the favorite at the French Open for the next 4 years+.   Federer is better because tennis is Wimbledon and Wimbledon is tennis. Nadal only has two Wimbledon’s and I don’t see him winning 2 more. Roger has 8. Roger also never lost in the 1st round of Wimbledon. Nadal lost in the 1st and 2nd round 4 years in a row in his prime.  Head to head Nadal has beat Fed but Fed is also 4.5 years older than Nadal. Nadal isn’t even in the top 5 grass court players in my opinion. Roger is probably the 4th best clay court player in history.   Djokovic is a great player but his personality is hard to like. He might be the only guy in the big 3 that ends up with multiple titles at each major though. Federer won’t win another French. He owns the Australian Open and It will be tough for Nadal.    Federer  Nadal   Djokovic   Sampras   Lendl   Borg   Connors   Also  let’s assume Roger and Rafa never existed...

Some context: Federer and Nadal are considered two of the best tennis players of all times (Federer is usually seen as the consensus GOAT). Federer and Nadal's rivalry was the defining storyline of the sport in the late 2000s and the early 2010s.  There are four tournaments in Tennis that are considered major tournaments  the Australian Open  the French Open  Wimbledon and the US Open. The Australian Open and the US Open are hardcourt tournaments  the French Open is a claycourt tournament and Wimbledon is a grasscourt tournament. Nadal is the greatest ever on clay  while Federer is the greatest on grass. As such Wimbledon is seen as sort of a ""home"" tournament for Federer.  This is the first time since 2008 (!) that Federer and Nadal meet at Wimbledon. This is extremely significant because that match was the [2008 Wimbledon finals  which is considered to be one of the greatest Tennis matches of all times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Wimbledon_Championships_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_singles_final). It is in this final that Nadal won Wimbledon for the first time  beating Federer on his favored surface. That match was considered a huge turning point in their rivalry at the time and many people thought it was the beginning of the end of Federer's dominance.  So this is Federer finally avenging what might be the toughest loss of his career  having had to wait eleven years for the opportunity.",,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.22715517241379315,88202,

Prior to the 2000's women's tennis had their own group of players that were always in the top 10 and winning. Women's tennis now is far less competitive with more mentally fragile players.  Safina- okay player but mentally not there and never won a slam  Halep- took her how many years to finally win a slam?? And her game is one dimensional  there is no net game  chip and charge  serve and volley no nothing. And even with all that lacking she is still top 3.   Kerber- spend most of her career getting beat up  it's only in the last 3.5 years that she got her head straight and started to be more competitive. But she is back to her earlier self is is again losing in the early round  Azarenka - same deal  highly unstable good player but she has more brutal loses than anyone. Even when she was ranked number one she would lose 6-1 and 6-2. Then she got knocked up by a dude  who wanted her child so she had to be off the tour for a few years and to this day is trying to recover.  Woz- no different than Halep  can make a deep run but loses to players outside of top 50 way too often. And now  she has arthritis issues so she's not very competitive (which even further illustrates how shallow women's tennis is at the moment)  I can go on and on! Women's tennis is lacking mentally strong player's like Serena  and Venus that's why both have been able to stick around for so long (especially Venus). Just look at the WTA top 20  it's a joke of a list.  Mens tennis will soon became like women's with guys like Zverev  Titsi  Shapo  Coric   Khachanov .... All okay players but all are mentally weak and simply can't hang in there with guys like Roger  Rafa  Novak  Murray. Can they beat them once in a while yes  but have consistent success  no  Men's tennis has been loaded for 20 years now but you can see that the upcoming generation is a few steps below the previous generations.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.10812893081761006,88273,

Both have winning h2h records over Roger. Novaks peak was higher than any player in history. Nadal was destroying Federer regularly during Federer's prime. Could beat him on any surface  particularly 08 French  08 Wimbledon and 09 Aussie  and he utterly dominated Federer on clay when Federer was the absolute king of tennis from 05-08. He still demolishes him on clay up until a month ago in straight sets at the French.  The 08 and 19 french are some of the biggest beatdowns Rogers received in grand slams.  Roger has more slams  more weeks at number one - but the VAST majority of these weeks occurred before Nadal or Djokovic peaked.  Novak is doing way better than Roger did when he was Novaks age  he could easily surpass Roger in slams. Both guys already have more Masters titles than Roger.  There's also context  Roger won 12 of his slams before Novak won his first in 2008. Rafa had also only won 3 to Rogers 12. Point being that every single one of Novak and Rafa's slams were one in literally the most talented era in the history of tennis. Roger was relatively unchallenged for a big chunk of his slams.  The fact that Novak has won every single slam ENTIRELY within the career span of the other two is batshit crazy. Nadal too but too a lesser extent.  I think Roger is GOAT  but to say the others aren't in the discussion shows you know very little about tennis.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.14072420634920638,88416,

Now true Federer racked up a load of wins before the others came on the circuit  but that was hardly a fallow period for tennis. He was having to beat Roddick  Sampras  Hewitt  Philippoussis and even a brief Agassi resurgence. And Nadal was a precocious kid so Federer didn't even have that long before he turned up. So I don't think Federer had any gimme titles and if Djoc gets 6  gimme titles now I don't think it will conclusively prove that he was ""better"" than Fed just because 21 > 20.

This is the end part of 'the run'. When you run with the bulls  most injuries are from people falling or from other runners. You might get the occasional gore. But anyway  at the end of the run  the people head into the bull ring  which is what you are seeing here. They let out a smaller bull and I believe their horns have been tipped. I watched this and nobody was injured. Even the people who the bull manage to hit.  Before they let the bull out  many of the runners line up in front of the gate crouched down and wait for the bull to charge out. It's expected that the bull will jump over you. But not always.

The sport survives in modern France  usually with cows rather than bulls  as course landaise; and in Spain  with bulls  as recortes.  Ritual leaping over bulls is a motif of Middle Bronze Age figurative art  notably of Minoan Crete  but also found in Hittite Anatolia  the Levant  Bactria and the Indus Valley. It is often interpreted as a depiction of a rite performed in connection with bull worship.  ***  ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/sports/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.04523809523809524,88749,

It is transfer season in the soccer world. Antoine Griezmann is currently one of the best strikers/forwards. He used to play for Atletico Madrid  another team in the same league as Barcelona. There was some drama because Griezmann wanted out of Atletico and Barcelona wanted to sign him. To do that  since he was still under contract with Atleti  Barcelona has to pay a release clause. Atleti is saying it was €200 million but Barcelona paid €120 million (hence the controversy).

While in other nations  some players have release clauses  it's definitely the exception and not the rule. In the case of a player with no release clause  the 2 clubs negotiate a fee. In rare situations  players also move as part of the fee as well. For example  a team might offer €50 million plus another player. It's important to note  that the player must agree to a contract with the team in that case.

It’s considered a “highly targeted” audience which is very enticing for sponsors. The demographic is not as broad as football or basketball so sponsors can really hone in with targeted commercials.  These sports are also considered “evergreen broadcasts” which means they’re great filler content for ESPN and whenever they have time between sports they’ll throw something like cornhole on the air.

In football 9 points is always a two-possession deficit because you'd need at least a touchdown and a field goal/safety  whereas 8 is achievable in a single possession (with a touchdown and a two-point conversion).  In cornhole  6 is two in the hole whereas 5 is one in the hole and two on top. Obviously it's hard to hit the hole so any time you can avoid having to get another bag in  it's better.  ~~You also have to get the exact score in cornhole which complicates things with 6. Imagine your first throw goes in and your second throw lands on top. I believe they throw 3 bags in professional leagues so you couldn't win in that possession (provided your opponent played in a way that's smart).

I don’t know the origins  but I’m pretty sure it started at some college campus. First time I played it was years and years ago. It’s so simple. Generally it’s played in teams of two. You set up two boards across from each other  say 15-20ft apart? (I don’t even know how far it should be but that sounds right). Your team mate is across from you behind the other board.  So one of your opponents is right next to you on your side. Each side has a turn. You alternate bean bag throw until yours are gone. (Most use 3-5 bean bags). Bean bags are color coded to the team (one is blue one is red for example). 1 pt for a bag on the board  3pts for one in the hole. However your opponents points take away from yours  basically whoever has the most points that ‘side’ gets the points. So let’s say on a turn  I get 2 on the board and 1 in the hole. I scored 5pts. My opponent gets 1 on the board and none in the hole. So I get 4pts because his one on the board negates one of mine.   So the score after the round is 4-0. The other side goes. My team mate throws the first bag their round  because I won when our side went. Then opponent throws the second  my team mate throws the third  etc until all bags are depleted. Round over  tally  and back to our side.  First one to 21 wins. Now there’s other rules like you can’t go over 21 or you drop back to 15  and you can play defense like trying to knock your opponents bag off the board  but that’s the just. It actually makes for a fantastic social game because you get to know people you just met (“anyone want to be my cornhole partner” at a party is common) and it’s just such fun competition.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.05553410553410554,89360,

It's essentially baseball but with a few difference. Here they are:  -Instead of 9 innings each team goes just once with 300 bowls (pitches) each.  -Instead of a diamond with 4 runs equaling 1 point  it's a single line and running across is a point.  - **Here is interesting part. There are 2 batsman active at any time. If you run an odd number after a hit  the other batsman starts hitting  since the bowler (pitcher) does not switch sides.**  -Instead of being out  with 3 strikes  you are out if the pitch hits the wicket which is the 3 stumps in the ground with 2 bails resting on top. If either of the bails gets knocked off  you are out.  -Instead of foul ball  you can hit it in any direction.  -Instead of home runs  hitting it outside the circle is 6 points. Hitting the ball which then rolls outside the circle is 4 points,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.0275974025974026,89690,

No idea how they came up with the concept 150 years ago.Cricket basically has many bowling options and many hitting options. You can use any trick you want to hit the ball anywhere in a 360 direction. Setting fields and bowling special lines that suit the field is a strategy the captain and bowlers have to suss out. The ball doing funny things bouncing off the pitch add another risk element for the batsmen.

In this format there are two innings  one for each team. The length of each innings is either 50 overs which is equal to 300 deliveries (pitches) or when the fielding team has taken ten wickets (gotten 10 outs) whichever happens first.   Runs are scored by hitting the ball into the field and running to opposite ends of the pitch (that flattened grass bit in the middle) each time both batsmen make it to the opposite end of the pitch they get one run  you can score multiple runs on a delivery. If you hit the ball over the boundary rope on the full it is six runs  if it bounces first it's four runs.  Unlike in baseball  batsmen are allowed to keep batting until they are given out which can happen in several different ways I'll get into later. So they can score many many runs.  Batsmen can be given out of dismissed in ten different ways although you only need to understand three concepts:  Caught  this is the most simple  the batsman hits the ball into the air and a fieldsman catches it on the full.  Bowled: The bowler (pitcher) bowls the ball and it hits the stumps (the three pegs behind the batsman)  Run-out/stumped The batsman is in front of their crease (safe-line  it's the white line on the pitch) and a fieldsman either throws or otherwise directs it into the stumps  if the batsman hits it first then it's called run-out  if not  it's called being stumped  only the wicketkeeper (the fieldsman with the gloves) can stump.  Scoring is written as AMOUNT OF RUNS/WICKETS FALLEN everywhere apart from Australia.   Hope that makes some sense  feel free to ask questions whenever  it should make sense once you watch a match or two  I can also help you find places to watch those,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.13660714285714287,89928,

Just curious as a baseball fan  and sports in general for comparative purposes since both sides of fandom have pointed out in this thread that their sport is better because of reasons. For instance  the hardest hit ball in MLB this season was 120.6 mph. Which is like 194 km/h. So to say that “In baseball they need gloves to make these types of catches” seems like a silly argument if the speeds are completely different. Also  what makes it being his “off hand” that much more difficult? In baseball most people catch with their “off hand” since their dominate hand is the one used to throw? Just trying to wrap my head around some of the differences. My kid caught some of the World Cup last month and was awe struck so we watched a bunch and tried to gain a better understanding.

I find both sides very hypocritical. Pakistan and Sri Lanka fans are a lot more tolerable now days compared to Bd and India probably due to their teams' deterioration. The Bd fandom got really toxic against India after the aforementioned quarter final against India when a legit ball by Rubel Hossain was called a no ball by the umpire saving Rohit Sharma from getting out. Since then many of the losses were attributed to India bribing/intimidating the umpires to swing the decisions in favor of them. A notable one being Liton Das stumping in Asia Cup where his leg did not cross the line and therefore was legitimately out. But Bangladesh fans with their infinite knowledge of the rules called it another example of umpires favoring Indians because ICC=BCCI=Pig3.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.19722222222222224,89979,

The average baseball off a bat is going faster than the average cricket ball off a bat. This leads to many cricket plays where a fielder can snap-catch a ball with either hand so a glove on one doesn't make sense  and throwing with any glove is just annoying. Baseball doesn't have many players snagging line drives out of midair so there's more time to position to catch the ball using the protected hand.   - missing a catch on a 4 in cricket isn't ideal but it's likely not a game breaker. Missing a crucial catch in baseball is much more likely to affect the outcome. (I accept that this is subjective from me watching both sports and others may find it complete bollocks).  - most importantly tradition. Baseball didn't have gloves until the late 1800s and the first players using them were mocked because it broke tradition and  yes  was considered soft. Now gloves in baseball are an accepted part of the game  American kids have all broken in baseball gloves  etc. Cricket's tradition is gloveless fielding and to wear a glove would be seen as bizarre as a hockey player wearing a visor in the 70s. Again the arguments against always come down to ""men don't need..."" but this argument is ridiculous and leads to players with career ending injuries in all sports  or life-ending injuries in the case of CTE. Go ahead and tell a modern hockey player that he's soft for wearing a visor and let me know how tough you feel afterwards. But tradition kept them from wearing them for ages  and tradition is massively important in cricket and unlikely to change anytime soon.",,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.06977124183006539,89985,

In cricket we have a saying ''catches win matches''  and missing a catch (on a 'fly ball') could be a game breaker  because it gives another life to the batsman  seeing that a batsman's wicket is very highly valued in cricket.   > but this argument is ridiculous and leads to players with career ending injuries in all sports  or life-ending injuries in the case of CTE.  In cricket  injuries to your hand while fielding is RARE.. For example  I cannot recall any fielder who got injured while fielding the ball without gloves in this world cup after 65 matches (including warmups) and 500+ hours of playtime. Infact I can't recall the last time a fielder got injured catching a ball. Catching a cricket ball is most definitely painful without any gloves  but that pain is expected and considered part and parcel of playing cricket. Every time I played cricket  it stung really hard when I was required to field a ball hit with good velocity or when taking a high catch. However since it's part and parcel of the game  you get on with it  or as the phrase goes: ''man up''.  Now a cricket ball is much harder and heavier than a baseball  this leads me to believe that the gloves in baseball are not really there to prevent injury but to actually facilitate the play (it's easier to catch the ball with gloves and throw back quickly) which flows with how baseball is played in the modern era.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.12875308641975314,90028,

There have been countless disputes between players and umpires on what is called a strike and a ball. It gets exponentially worse the lower the competition level and by the time you watch the little league world series  anyone with a set of eyes could probably do a better job than the umps at that level.   While it doesn't happen every game  you could potentially cut out a lot of time for when a manager comes out of the dugout to argue a call. If a computer is accurately making the calls  there should be no dispute from the teams making games not last as long as they do. The fact that they are doing this shows that the umpires are failing at their job.   Here's an article from ESPN that shows that umpires get worse the older they are. In my opinion  I'd prefer that the calls at the plate are perfectly called. It gives pitchers and batters a consistent strike zone and there shouldn't be any debate on whether the call was correct or not.  https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/26467659/study-young-umps-top-older-peers-calls,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.07861111111111113,90075,

And they're all the same (no home  1st  etc). The pitcher is trying to hit the sticks. The batter is trying to protect them. When the batter hits the ball  he has to run to the next base. He can be made Out by either catching the ball or if the ball hit the sticks. Like a force out  except no one needs to actually catch the ball and tag the base. There are no strikes. You're just out or not. You get 10 outs. There are no foul balls in cricket.  Overall  after watching both  it seems like baseball sacrifices a lot of the constant movement and action if cricket  but seems to gain in moments where the players make some truly miraculous plays. This is a great throw (and I've seen a ton of awesome bare-handed catches lately) but man  seeing some guy throw a laser from deep in the outfield to beat a guy rounding third to the plate just makes me feel some sort of way too.  Edit: Thanks for humoring me those of you who've responded.

Right  now the definitions are out of the way  let's begin!   In cricket  the batsman (running bloke) can be out in a few different ways. Before we get to this dismissal though  we need some context. To score in cricket you can hit a boundary (where the ball leaves the playing field (relatively rare)  or score runs by running up and down the pitch while the fielders (the guys in black without the bats) return the ball.   While the batsman (cricket for batter) is out of the crease (again  white line in front of the stumps (posts)) he can be run out. This is when the ball is thrown into the stumps  removing the bails (the little sticks that come off the top of the stumps). It's important to note that the bails must be removed for the batsman to be dismissed!   The man at the stumps (Colin de Grandhomme  if you're interested) could have caught the ball and knocked the bails off if he thought the throw was going to miss. As long as the batsman has not grounded any party of his bat or body over the crease he would still have been out. However  that would take more time and the batsman would likely have been in his crease  thus not out  which adds to how excellent this run out it.   As you have noticed there are some similarities between cricket and baseball  but they are very different beasts. If you're into bat and ball sports though  you will likely enjoy cricket. It's not as complicated as a lot of people think  it basically boils down to hitting a ball around an oval to score runs.  I didn't mention there are 9 other ways for the batsman to be dismissed (out)  ranging in rariety.   Hope this answers some questions  if you have any more reply or fire me a message  I just love talking about the game!,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.11067460317460316,90213,

He's safe once he or his bat crosses the line (called the crease). To get the batsman out  a fielder either has to catch the ball out of air  or pick up the ball and throw it into the wicketkeeper who while holding it can break the stumps (those vertical sticks you see)  or directly throw the ball at the stumps and break them  before the batsman crosses the crease and becomes safe.  The stumps are only a few inches in diameter  so they are really skinny targets to hit.  From 35 yards out  Guptill (Black) picked up the ball and threw it directly at the stumps with perfect accuracy  getting Dhoni (Blue) out  who was a fraction of an inch from crossing the crease.  It was particularly crucial because this was toward the end of the game when India had a legitimate chance to win  and Dhoni is known for being particularly clutch in crucial moments  so this out basically sealed the game and gave New Zealand the win.

If the ball bounces infield first  you get 4 runs. But if it doesn't (like a home run) then you get 6 runs.  An 'Over' - Bowler gets six attempts at the batsmen. After this six  the fielding team switches ends (not the batsmen) and another bowler gets six attempts. Bowlers specialise in different styles of bowling. (Spin bowling: https://youtu.be/eZyQQl_YYRM & Swing bowling: https://youtu.be/iboakCXwvgw)  Four ways to be out -   1: The bowler hits the stumps from his bowl.  2: The ball is hit and somebody on the fielding team catches it (same as baseball).  3: Run out & Stumped - Similar to baseball. If the batsmen are not in their crease (on their base)  which is the white lines in the above video around the wooden stumps  then the fielders can get them out by hitting the wooden stumps before the batsmen get to them. (https://youtu.be/ilyWOLGo6zA)  4: LBW. It means 'leg before wicket'. Basically you can only stop the ball from hitting the stumps with your bat. If you do it with your legs then it's LBW.

He was throwing from side-on  so he could aim at one stick  not all three.   This is unquestionably difficult. Imagine if a pitcher’s strike zone in baseball was only 1.5 inches wide. That’s how difficult this throw was.  More importantly  this was during the final moments of the game. The batsman who got run out is widely known as one of the most clutch finishers in this generation of international cricket. Had he not gotten out  he might have won the game for India.

I can try to explain it as a series of comparisons if you want  Ok  here goes:  ####Aim   Score more runs than the opponent in a given number of innings before your batters get out - so far the same.  ####Field   Take two baseball diamonds  rotate one 180 degrees and place home plate on top of the pitcher's mound from the the first field. Join the foul poles up in a big oval  forget 1st/2nd/3rd base and the foul lines. Batters hit from each home plate (two in at a time)  pitchers pitch from the other home plate. Catcher stays in the same place  everyone else is effectively an outfielder and can stand wherever they like.  [This is what it looks like](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/05/39/2f/05392f194fb180cbb9c918dacff6f748.jpg)  the boundary is the outfield fence and the pitch in the middle is the area between the pitcher's mound and home plate.  ####Play   1st and 2nd batters from your batting order come out  one to each home plate  and the 1st batter faces a pitch from the opening pitcher. He can leave as many pitches as he likes  there are no bases on balls or fould balls and if he hits the ball and makes contact it's up to him whether he runs. If he does run  he must make it to where the pitcher pitched from  and the other batter must make it to where he just batted from - this is a single  and scores one run. You can run a double (just swap back over again) or a triple (keep swapping) but if you've not hit the ball well enough you might ground out (come on to how to get out in a bit).   You stay in until you are out  scoring runs does not end your at bat.   A home run (fly over the outfield fence) is automatically six runs  an automatic double (bounce over the outfield fence) gets you four. Whoever is at the end the pitcher is pitching at faces the next pitcher  if you hit a four or a six you don't have to run and you face the next pitch.   You keep accumulating runs until there are 10 outs  and that's the end of an innings. The score is denoted as ""runs - outs""  pronounced ""runs for outs"" so you could be ""3 for 1"" or ""564-9"".   Every six pitches  you switch which end is being pitched from and who is doing the pitching. The batters do not swap at this point. This is an over  and some games are limited by number of pitches (either 20 overs/120 pitches or 50 overs/300 pitches) per side.  ####Getting Out   There are 10 ways of getting out  and you can only get one out per pitch:  * Caught - a fly out  could be a line out or a pop fly  either way you are caught and that's it * Bowled - if you leave a strike  just once  you are out - we have three wooden sticks (wicket) to denote the strike zone so no worrying about hernandez's dodgy strike zone * Leg Before Wicket - use your body to protect the strike zone? No free single for you  that's out! * Run out - what you see here  a ground out: if the ball hits the wicket when you aren't on the bag (outside the white line) you are out  and it's always a force out so no need to tag the player. * Stumped - leave the batters box to swing at a ball  and the catcher grabs it? if he can hit the wicket before you are back in the batter's box  you are out (just like a run out) * Hit wicket - if you lean back and hit your wicket with your bat  you are out (like you'd probably get thrown out if you hit the catcher with your bat) * Hit the ball twice - it would have to be obvious  not two contacts in one swing broken-bat style  but you can be out for this * Obstructing the field - rare  but the same as baseball * Timed out - don't get to the batter's box quickly enough? You're out! * Retired - you can retire hurt or just because you feel like it.  Once you are out  the next batter from the batting order comes up to bat  but whoever was batting with you stays batting as well. Therefore you only need 10 outs to retire the side  as even though there are 11 batters you can't bat without a partner.  ####Players   There are 11 players on each team - 1 catcher and 10 outfielders. Everybody bats  National League style  and you'd expect to have 3-4 dedicated batters at the top of the order  3-4 who can bat and pitch  and 3-4 who are specialist pitchers. The catcher will be one of your dedicated batters  but selected more on catching ability.   One of your players will be the captain - the coaching staff are nowhere near the field of play  so the captain is in control when you are in the field  chooses who will pitch next and works with the pitcher to tell the fielders where to go.  There are a lot of fielding positions  as shown [here](http://www.dangermouse.net/cricket/fielding.gif) - shifts are often used so they aren't cast iron places to stand  but a rough guide. You can only use 9 of them at a time  as there must be a catcher and pitcher.  ####Summary   Two pitchers pitch 6 pitches at a time each from the mound to home plate on a 360 degree field  the batters try to score runs and keep going unless they are out  there are 10 ways to get out (some a lot more common than others) and whoever has the most runs when you are out of innings or pitches wins.

What I like about cricket--limited overs cricket at least--is that the state of the match while the second team is batting can be almost entirely described in numbers (X runs needed  with Y balls left and Z wickets remaining) and how every single bowl--however inconsequential it may be in that moment--alters that equation ever so slightly.

Well done. Only thing wrong is if you retire hurt you're technically not out. But your team still concedes the innings if they cannot field any more batters so the effect is the same.   I'd say the most important things to add are:  - unlike pitching  bowling is the art of throwing a ball with a straight arm by running up to the point of delivery  whirling your arm over your head  and letting go at the highest point. You are not allowed to bend your arm at all  and so the speed comes from your run and the one action of your straigtened arm whipping around. There are lots of different bowling styles  which I would be delighted to explain. Also you are allowed  indeed encouraged  to allow the ball to bounce before it reaches the batsman. In fact if it doesn't bounce then it's only a legal delivery if it is travelling very low indeed  so almost all balls will bounce.  - it's not that shifts are often used. Shifts are used constantly. As you pointed out there are around sixty different places where you might logically place a fielder but you can only place people in 9 of those positions at any given time.   So the main job of a captain  in consultation with their bowler  and in accordance with the bowling plan and the conditions and the state of the match  is to decide which positions they're going to fill and where they're going to leave gaps.   In addition in this form of the game  and other short forms  there will be rules about how many fielders you can have outside an inner ""circle"" 30 yards away from the pitch. In this format for example you're only allowed 2 outside the inner circle for the first 1/5th  4 for the 2nd to 4th 1/5ths and 5 in the final 1/5th  So what's classic is something like [this](http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/42363000/gif/_42363332_one_day_field_416.gif) where you've got two men on the boundary (Presumably this is at the start where you're not allowed any more) and they're both behind the batsman because you're expecting the batsman to play shots off the back foot (so the bowler is probably intending to bounce the ball short  to produce back foot shots)  you've got the wicketkeeper directly behind the batsman (that's required) and he has a friend  called a ""slip"" which is an attacking position for the catch coming of the bat's edge. Then everyone else is in defensive positions as far back as the rules allow  there are no other closefielders or people in classic catching positions - the gully  point and mid on are right back  there is no square leg or mid off. So this is a highly defensive field  only one person in a proactive ""I am going to get you out"" position  the rest all just trying to stop the bleeding. On this occasion they're mostly on the ""off"" ie bat side so presumably this bowler is planning to bowl a bit wide of the wicket so the batsman has to hit it to off (or take the risky step of moving across to play it to the other (leg) side)",,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.0935512129380054,90273,

A test match ends when both teams have had two innings each (you get to the bottom of the second). As this needs 40 outs total  it can take up to 5 days. A one day international is limited to 300 pitches per side  but if you get all 10 outs then you can stop earlier.  Whoever has the most runs at the determined end point wins  same as baseball.

The ""300 pitches"" is actually usually referred to as ""50 overs"" (u/commbeseh was keeping it simple for you). There's a third format of the game that was introduced in the last couple of decades or so and has become very popular  called ""Twenty 20"" (or simply ""T20"")  in which each side gets one innings of 20 overs each. Since these matches usually last around 3-4 hours  they are much more analagous to a baseball game  and also more ""TV-friendly"" than the 50-over version (which lasts an entire day) or Test versions of the game.  Interestingly  Test cricket matches can end based on score difference OR time  which is the beauty of the strategy. You have five days to complete the match  otherwise it's declared a draw  regardless of how far ahead one team may be in terms of runs. Completing the match means both teams get their full two innings (10 outs each). So if the match is completed and one team has more runs than the other  it wins the match. However--and here's the funhouse part--if one team is winning by a lot of runs and is still batting  they may say  ""you know what--at this rate  the other team won't get its chance to complete its second innings if we keep batting  so we're just going to stop batting  and let them have their turn at bat"" (which is known as ""declaring""). The tricky part is: when do you have enough runs that you feel the other team won't be able to overtake you and win by having more runs than you  but not so many runs (i.e. you've batted so long) that the other team won't have enough time left to complete its innings (and thus despite you having more runs  the match is now just a draw)? It's a very tough decision sometimes  and is part of what makes Test cricket fascinating to watch over the course of a week.",,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.1401169590643275,90307,

There are three different formats. This is ""one day cricket"" which is like baseball if baseball lasted all day and was as much a test of concentration and patience (on the part of the payers) as it was skill.   Then there's 2020 cricket which is honestly almost identical to baseball  just as you say a little bit different with the rules but also the style. So the tactics are all around bowling techniques and field positions and that makes a big difference. But otherwise it's very similar to baseball in that it's about the guile of the bowler and the hand eye coordination and technique of the batsman. (Actually I guess that's a bit different too  the batsman's technique is a bit more sophisticated than in baseball: it's like wielding a sword instead of a club)  Then there's Test Cricket  which is much mocked but which I adore as being an unbelievable game of strategy and determination. Games last five days or two completed innings per team  whichever happens sooner  and its a real test of patience and determination and also of proper grand strategy. It's great to see two sporting teams plot out a week long military campaign of a game. And it makes the individual breakthrough moments so meaningful and powerful.   Any form of cricket is a great day out  or a great afternoon's TV  but the real way to follow cricket  I think  is to be vaguely aware of what's going on either coz the radio is on or because you're semi-regularly checking the score  and then to tune in for the final hour or so of what by then has turned in to the denouement of a gripping week long narrative.",,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.1974264705882353,90334,

Runs are relatively easy to score in cricket  since there's only 11 fielders and a 360-degree field you can hit to (lots of holes in the defense). So there's generally no sense in trying to score a run if there's even a question as to whether you will be ""run out"" (sort of like a groundball out in baseball). Generally  the batsmen will only run if the ball is hit to an empty space (which happens often). However  there's also plenty of times when the ball is fielded quickly by a fielder  so there's not enough time for the batsmen to swap ends to score a run. Rather than risk it  they just wait for the next ball to be delivered (i.e. next pitch).  And as others have mentioned  outs are hugely important--there's only 10 needed in an entire match  which can last hours.

I should also add that since the non-Test versions of cricket feature a limited number of overs  there is a definite incentive to the batsmen to score runs as often as they can. In other words  the batsmen could theoretically stand out there all day and never run; but after 300 balls have been delivered  the innings is over. So there's an incentive to score as many runs as you can by running after you hit the ball  if possible.  It's slightly less so in Test cricket. Test cricket has a time limit  not an overs limit. So it's more about not making outs  rather than scoring as many runs as you can on a finite number of balls delivered to you as in limited-overs cricket.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.1263227513227513,90374,

They study  for hours  the specific pitch types the opposing pitchers have in their arsenal  which is a unique fingerprint/puzzle for each pitcher. Every single at bat can be an extremely technical mental battle between batter and pitcher  witch each trying to predict what the other is doing.  Hitting off a major league baseball pitcher is probably one of the hardest things to do with regularity in sports. Often times at this level of skill  batters cannot get a hit unless they guess what pitch is coming and commit to hitting it based on that expectation  because the limits of human reaction time is about the same amount of time it takes a pitch to reach home plate. Other times the ball has movement on it that batters have to either recognize the pitchers specific body mechanics and/or the spin on the ball as it leaves their hand to swing at the correct location.  It's *kind of* like a keeper in soccer defending against a PK  though probably better odds than that.  I'm not really doing the interaction justice. There's much more that goes into it  and we're just talking about pitcher vs batter right now. At the same time  some batters and pitchers have a lot less going on technically and rely more on natural skills without as much technical input  so I guess baseball is more of an ""as technical as you want to make it"" kind of sport.",,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.15519688644688642,90568,

Winning/losing by 18 runs in Cricket means it was a *really* close game. Each team faces 300 balls (pitches)  you get one run when the batsmen run to the opposite end  4 runs when they hit it to the 360degree boundary with at least one bounce and 6 runs when they hit it out of the park like a home run.

Also  the leather is supposedly shinier  making it harder for pitchers to grip the ball and giving it less wind resistance in the air. It is believed to be juiced all around.  Post 1920  when the spitball was banned  the ball was believed to be juiced  but in actuality  they stopped using 1 ball per game and the new always-fresh ball was easier to see and hit. The ball was always new so it was also springier by nature. In the 1930s the National League was hurting in attendance due to all the stars in the American League like Babe Ruth. They deliberately juiced the ball by reducing the height of the seams to increase offense by hurting the pitcher's ability to throw breaking balls. It worked. Batting averages went way up during that time. In 1987  there was an extravaganza of home runs. Analysis showed that the balls were juiced. The next year  they over corrected and 1988 was a deadball year. The steroid years didn't need balls being tinkered with  but lately the balls have been way livelier than before.

Its so fun to see people who boulder  some are slow moving yet very focused  others rush it and use momentum to their advantage. Technique here is what your body can do and how it functions best.

First  the time for climbing these ""sport"" routes is fairly limited  so they can't just hang out as long as they want. When outdoor climbing  there is not really a time limit  so a climber may do these no-hands rests for 5+ minutes if they are trying get a proper rest so they can do a route without falling. Second  in this instance  Alex has to climb back down to get into the correct body position to start climbing again  and that can be pretty awkward and risky. In general  it's better to not do extra movements like that since they force Alex to keep his right hand ""locked off"" at a 90 degree angle while he falls back down into the correct body position.   At the end of the day  all these climbers have a short amount of time to even look at the route  so they may figure out different ways to do the routes.

Those places are really ideal when climbing lead as they allow you to rest shortly  shake out your hands and get chalk back on your hands without the need to really have any strain on either hand at all times. This makes them ideal to take a short break before the next hard section.   Climbing lead means that you are climbing the route without the rope being already in the highest point  (if it would be  the style would be called ""top rope""). That means that you will need to plan your climb accordingly. You will need to get the rope in the quickdraws once you are at their height (and sometimes/usually you will need to place the quickdraws in the bolts before that).   It also means that you are not allowed to put any weight on the rope before you finish the route (or your attempt won't count)  which would be another way for easy rest (just sit in the rope at a quickdraw).  What all this means that a) the climb is harder physically as you can't just rest while sitting in the rope and b) the climb is harder psychologically as you will fall way more distance than you would if you'd top rope  (basically no fall at all besides the stretch of the rope).

The one I was referencing was from a while ago and it used a grip strength tester (hand dynamometer) which you squeeze and it tells you how many pounds of pressure were applied. They couldn't tell which people were the climbers and which were other athletes. Random examples but here is Alex Honald using a hand dynamometer test his strength: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UjFw-CXFby4  And here is a random youtuber: https://youtu.be/fK6GQVkIpno   Here's another random old dude who scored higher than Alex: https://youtu.be/S7brRCMR_mc  Neither of those guys look like elite athletes   It seems other studies have had contradictory results. This study  for example  says that it has a lot to do with climbers endurance in their forarms  which is not the same as strength.   https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5260593/   Climbing absolutely has a lot to do with a technique.  A novice climber won't know a good body position for a small crimp so they'll be forced to hold the entire weight on their fingers.  An elite climber will know how better technique for holding the crimp (open vs closed) and better footwork to get weight onto the feet and off of the fingers. Put any inexperienced climber on a small crip and they will close their grip and grip way too hard and burn themselves out instantly.

When you have a route as a project often you eventually figure out all the moves  are able to do them  and the final challenge is stringing it all together for the send.

First of all  yes  climbing routes in gyms and outdoors generally have a difficulty grade that helps define how ""hard"" it is to get to the top. These competition routes are different  as they generally A) are designed to get harder as you get higher b) have ""gates"" or ""crux"" moves that are spread through the climb to separate the pack. See [this recent post](https://old.reddit.com/r/climbing/comments/cakjlq/all_crux_attempts_moves_3536_from_the_womens_lead/) for a good example of a hard crux.   At this level  the setters are themselves very hard climbers. Usually they can ""forerun"" or try out the routes - at least sections of them - before the competitors. That is not required however  as an good routesetter can absolutely set routes that are vastly too hard for them to climb themselves. That comes from their experience  training  and professionalism.  Also note  the climbers in competition  especially at finals  have been climbing hard for days to get there. By the time they get to a finals route  their skin may be thin  they're likely physically tired  and maybe banged up from climbing (it's a rough sport). This is compounded by the rigors of travel and time zones  PLUS the fact that they're sometimes competing every weekend or even every few days on the grueling world cup circuit. It's a war of attrition  and its not unusual for climbers to miss an event or two (or a season) due to injury.   The setters job is wicked hard  as they have to make the climbs hard enough to separate out the pack  not too easy (everyone tops) or too hard (no one tops)  and also making the comp an exciting show for the audience. Even the armchair setter like me can say that the routesetters this week in Villars did an objectively terrible job. The worst case scenario is for too many people to top  as what's required then is to ""count back"" to how well they did on previous climbs to calculate whether they should advance. Strike that - the **WORST** worst case scenario is when even counting back doesn't solve it  and you have to look at *how fast the competitor climbed*.

You're the guy writing those World Cup briefings in the subreddit! I really love your stuff man  my dream is to read climbing highlights on the morning news like we already hear for hockey/baseball/etc. Your stuff is great.   Though I frame it as a pretty dire thing  I'm accepting of the fact that they have to rank the climbers *somehow*  and callbacks and time are the only real way to do it. To answer your question  I probably wouldn't change it  as I weigh the progress under ""normal"" conditions more highly. I mean to say that I don't feel like climbers are really rushing on the routes  taking measured use of time. I think if they could somehow perceive that ""oh wow  we're topping left and right I'd better hurry"" they would  but that's also disadvantageous to early climbers and also why we use isolation for finalists. Hence  callbacks to normal (non-rushed) climbs are a better metric.  I'd personally like to see a mechanism for a tie-break or something.

This is very evident with Adam Ondra  regarded as one of  if not the  best climber in the world. He has set the two hardest outdoor lead climbing routes in the world (9b+ and then a 9c) and he is the only one to ever complete them.  And yet he does not finish gold every time in comps simply because the moves he is used to outdoors does not translate completely to competition bouldering/lead climbing.  As an aside: 8c-8d is very difficult. People could practice for many years and still never reach this level and it would completely normal. It normally would takes multiple years of focused training as well as innate individual talent.  So yes these are the best climbers in the world.

Your fingers DO have tendons (and ligaments)  connected to muscles  and the tendons can be conditioned and enlarge with extreme use. This is one reason the pro climbers have huge fingers.

Don't be condescending  it's a civil discussion. I'm just pointing out that an experienced athlete that it would benefit didn't think it would be healthy - an appeal to authority if you will. Don't respond in bad faith.  >why have a timer at all?   Fewer hard moves are more interesting for the audience than the resistance climbing that dominated back when the timer was 8 minutes. Of course you could take that to its eventual conclusion and just have really short 10 move routes but then that doesn't test aerobic endurance really at all  so the question is at what arbitrary point does that stop.  I wouldn't say faster is necessarily the most efficient even. Take Tomoa  he cut loose really quite often on the semi final when other climbers just bumped their heels around. He flew through but you really can't say that style is the most efficient. He got the high point **in spite of that**. Imo if he topped the finals he'd've deserved to win not because of his speed but because he performed better in the previous round.  Jain Kim is known as a super elegant climber and I think you'd be hard pressed to say her moves are inefficient. Yet she climbs slowly and controlled. When they first dropped the timer to 6 minutes she had many issues with getting timed out because of her style  and she was punished by the timer. But she is still is a super efficient climber in her movement. If she topped out a route slower than another climber  it's not because of her inefficiency but just that's her style - if her style allowed her to get higher than that same climber in a previous round it's because she performed better  more consistently over the competition. That's deserving of the better place in my opinion.  >even the commentators this time around were not sure whether time or count back was more important.

In all seriousness  I’m happy to defer to the opinion of any pro climber. Just throwing my two cents in.  Your comments on how the time limit influences the setting are really important  and it’s in that respect that I can see how it is necessary outside of only scoring.   I suppose my belief is this - in an onsight format  regardless of a climber’s style  overall time to finish is indicative of how well the route was read from observation to top. I don’t think incorporating time as a scoring factor unduly favors a certain style  as there are always advantages and disadvantages to a dynamic vs static approach when it comes to actual progress on the route  which is ideally what we want to separate the field.  Janja and Tomoa  both in bouldering and lead  are often able to succeed because of the advantages that come with their dynamism. On the other hand  we can also see how too much momentum can lead to mistakes  as Tomoa showed in the finals. Jain Kim can be slower as you said  but if this affords her increased accuracy  then she’s in a better position to set the high point. Setters usually create routes that require both styles of climbing to complete  so I tend to think that dynamic vs static (in lead anyways) is a wash. You have to do both.  Sure  if speed mattered more  competitors could hit the gas and try to complete routes in a faster time  but there is a legitimate trade-off with endurance and accuracy that I don’t believe we’d see such situations often - provided that the routes are set appropriately. When they aren’t set well  that’s where we get into trouble.  A cogent example for me would be Alex Megos and Sasha Lehmann in the Men’s final. Alex got into an interesting no hands rest position  but it was clear that the intended beta was different  and he ended up using a lot of time trying to navigate off the hold. Sasha had little problem reading the route  and while he wasn’t fast by any means  naturally ended up topping in a faster time. In this case  even if Sascha had placed lower in the semis  it’s hard for me to feel like he wouldn’t deserve a higher place than Alex.  Thanks for the conversation  it’s really good to get other perspectives on this.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.17668831168831167,91503,

Men’s players get 7 percent of the revenue their World Cup generates. The reason the men make more is that they generate well over four times as much. If anything  the women are overpaid.  ​  To be clear  the women's soccer players have specifically complained about the ""gender pay gap"" in the FIFA prize money. They want equal pay to the men  even though the men's World Cup earns 50 or 60 times the amount in revenue. We're talking 6 billion vs 100 some million.  ​   With the US teams the pay gap has actually closed in recent years:  ​  According to figures provided by U.S. Soccer  since 2008 it has paid 12 players at least $1 million. Six of those players were men  and six were women. And the women hold their own near the top of the pay scale; the best-paid woman made about $1.2 million from 2008 to 2015  while the top man made $1.4 million in the same period. Some women in the top 10 even made more than their male counterparts over those years.  ""The really significant pay gap  and the one that gets most of the press  is in the World Cup payouts. FIFA  the international soccer organization  will give about $400 million to male players in the World Cup  while female players will make around $30 million. When you hear that male players make 10 times what female players make  this is the figure that justifies the claim.  ​  They want it internationally  where the pay is definitely not close to equal. But that inequality  as Forbes explains  is entirely due to the astronomical disparity in revenue.  ​  As Dwight Jaynes pointed out four years ago after the U.S. women beat Japan to capture the World Cup in Vancouver  there is a big difference in the revenue available to pay the teams. The Women's World Cup brought in almost $73 million  of which the players got 13%. The 2010 men's World Cup in South Africa made almost $4 billion  of which 9% went to the players.The men still pull the World Cup money wagon. The men's World Cup in Russia generated over $6 billion in revenue  with the participating teams sharing $400 million  less than 7% of revenue. Meanwhile  the Women's World Cup is expected to earn $131 million for the full four-year cycle 2019-22 and dole out $30 million to the participating teams.  So that is $6 billion v. $131 million. The women aren't even in the same universe  in terms of revenue. If the women were paid the same total as the men — $400 million — they would be making nearly four times more than they generate. The men make 7% of their revenue. The women apparently want 400% of theirs. That's absurd  obviously  to say the least.  ​  Megan Rapinoe  humble as always  will settle for just a meager quadrupling of their prize money. But $30 million quadrupled is $120 million. That would be close to 100 percent of their revenue. Again: The men only make 7%. Already  the women are earning around 20%. Indeed  if we want to be ""fair"" and ""equal "" we must conclude that the women are overpaid. Or else the men are underpaid. Either way  on an international scale  if there is a gender pay gap  women are the beneficiaries of it. """,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.07881944444444443,91510,

Just look at 2018 World Cup viewership.  Any serious analysis of this from a revenue perspective would need to adjust for viewers who are primarily interested in watching national teams other than the US. It doesn't make sense to say that the US Men get X% of revenue that the USSF receives from a tournament they don't participate in (or crash out of in the group stage). By that standard  I have been massively underpaid by the USSF.

It makes a lot of sense to me that USSoccer would be actively involved in supporting the NWSL until it becomes financially viable  even to the extent that they might spend more on the Women's sport than the Men's.  Once/if the NWSL becomes self-sustaining  and salaries for women climb above the poverty line  then I would expect the money spent on Women to decrease in favor of other activities.

Is it really only a year or two at a time? (comparing it to the other major sports in the US  which are typically 8-10 years long).   If that's the case  that's really tough. The article does make it seem like their Player's Association takes on some of this. If the CBA is renewed in such short increments  it really speaks that the members of the USWNT don't think they can win in negotiations with the USSF  which is probably their main motivation for bringing up the lawsuit.  If you're right about the CBA lengths  I don't think they have a shot to win. The judge/courts are going to tell them to negotiate the deal they want and if they don't like it they can negotiate with another Soccer Association. This is the EXACT reason the MLB's CBA is considered the most player friendly one in the world. They literally have arbitration from year to year for basically everyone. An independent panel assess all the metrics and they pick an appropriately salary based on the situation (and taking into consideration both the Team's expected salary and the Player's expected salary).

More than the men  actually  and there are good arguments for both sides. But you havent accounted for sponsoships  length of pre-tournment play and regular season television ratings  these things arent incorperated in the revenues you provided above. First id like to say that womens soccer didnt become overwhelminingly popular until 2016  so they havent had a platform to stand on until these last few years. So it makes sense why they are using this argument now for greater compensation  i know i would. Secondly  although women generate a higher revenue during cup games  which is great. During regular season games the men get 4X as many veiwers  generating way more money during regulation seasons. Also  women play only 5 qualifying games for the world cup why the men play 16  thats a big difference for games that count and people watching. Lastly  sponsorships work differently from sport to sport  but thats a completely different conversation. Yet  sponsorships are still an area that men make way more money in.   Here is a good argument for women  although they do get paid less for games  they play more games in a season  which brings their pay up substantially. They need to work harder for longer for fair compensation (which if you look at the player to player pay its actually pretty close for top men vs top women throughout an entire season). I personally think  as most people will  that more games should equal more money. But to add and to repeat myself  if women had higher television ratings for regular season games.... their pay would skyrocket! So  you just need to get people to watch more of those.

With women the strength of the programs correlate much more directly with the national federations investment into those sports and the investment into the supporting systems (like college and Title IX).  To pick a random country as an example:  I'd imagine a country like Ghana would have to invest quite a substantial % of it's GDP to build up a very competitive women's national team  partly because there's no underlying systems or player pool to support it.  Whereas on the men's side with the economics of the club teams  the best male players from Ghana are most likely scouted by European clubs at a very young age and are moved to and developed in Europe.  Then when it comes time for national duty  voila  Ghana can have a decent men's team without much investment from their federal government.  It's the economics of the private club teams that makes the international competitions much less about national wealth for men than for women.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.15166666666666667,91915,

I do think A LOT of women from this team will not be playing 4 years from now.  Sauerbrunn is 34 (so this was likely her last world cup)  O'Hara is 30 (so will be 34 in 4 yrs  will a younger player take her spot? i hope not  i just love her!)  Dunn is only 27  so perhaps she'll be back  Abby Dahlkemper is 26 (so she'll be 30...).  Krieger is 34  so this was her last world cup as well.  &#x200B;  For midfield  it gets better.  Julie Ertz is 27 (so she will be 31 in 4 yrs).  Rose Lavelle is only 24  so i have to imagine she'll be back.  Mewis is 26 (so 30 in 4 yrs)  Lindsey horan is only 25 (so I imagine she'll be back).    &#x200B;  Up front  well  this isn't great either.  Rapinoe is 34 (doubt she'll be back for another world cup)  Carli Lloyd is 36 (she stated this was her last one)  Alex Morgan is 30  and USA soccer will want her to stick around in 4 years  tobin Heath is already 31  so she'll be 35 next world cup...since she is 100% soccer  I could see he returning.  Christen Press is even 30 now  so she'll be 34 next world cup.  &#x200B;  The point is  most of the starters on THIS squad will likely retire before the next world cup or be at or over 30 yrs old. As much as i hate to say it  most athletes lose a step crossing over 30.  Soccer sometimes  because of the vast amount of cardio  might delay that  but the women will definitely age.  And i'm not saying any woman could not come back from child birth (as many have already)  but the next 4 years for these ladies could certainly change in that regard also.  &#x200B;  It's not all bad...Mallory Pugh could've easily started for pretty much every other team in the world cup  she's only 21 (will be 25 next world cup)  Alyssa Naeher is 31 (but for goalkeepers  that's not too terrible)  Morgan Brian is 26  Tierna Davidson is only 20.  &#x200B;  Basically I see at least 1/3rd of the entire roster not returning....possibly up to 50% (because some of the bench players like Adrianna Franch is 38).  &#x200B;  It'll certainlyl be a different team in 4 years...but this particular team was probably the deepest and most loaded with talent roster we've ever had!,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.09748376623376624,91929,

There’s too much money involved and too many people making it for that to change. Do the math: With about 3 million boys and girls registered youth players paying  say  an average of $1 500 each per year  that’s a $4.5 billion industry.  >Here’s how it goes: You sign up your kid for rec soccer at age 6  just to get them outside running around  innocently wanting them to absorb the values of team sports.  >At 8  acting on the universal fear of parents not wanting their kid to fall behind  you join a club. It costs $1 200 to $1 500 per year  plus another couple hundred for tournaments  plus the hidden cost of gas and hotels for that out-of-town tournament so you can tell your friends your kid is on a “travel team ” plus $12 to park at some venues. You also might hire private coaches at $50 or $100 per hour.  >At 10  you are recruited to a more prestigious  more expensive club loaded with big  strong kids that has better chance of winning State Cups  since most parents  not versed in the nuances of the sport  equate trophies with development.  >At 13  if your kid is good enough  you make a team in the U.S. Soccer Development Academy. It costs $2 500 to $3 000 per year  and the travel can double or triple that amount. You practice four days a week  take plane trips for some away games  aren’t guaranteed playing time on rosters that can be as large as 24  are discouraged from playing other sports and are forbidden from playing high school soccer.

High-end soccer isn't a matter of applying pure atheticism.  If it were  the best players in the world would also be the biggest and fastest  but with a few notable exceptions  they aren't.  Take Messi --arguably the GOAT.  He's a little dude.  Sure he's fast and fit as fuck  but his real talent lies in his genius for reading the pitch and understanding how a ridiculously complex series of events are going to unfold in microseconds.  You can't get to that level overnight.  MLS accordingly  because soccer has never been big in North America --outside of Mexico obviously  which is why Liga MX is still better than MLS-- lacks the combination of homegrown talent and big money that it needs if it is ever to seriously compete with the ""big 5"" European leagues.    MLS *can* eventually get there  but it's decades behind the world's other big-time soccer systems and therefore was always going to require decades of work to reach anything like parity with them  despite what you may have been told by its boosters.    That said  there are parts of North America where MLS is going gangbusters.  I live in Portland where the Timbers are a very close 2nd to the 'Blazers in terms of popularity.  Since the Timbers' MLS reinvention in 2011  for example  they have sold out every single home game they've ever played.  MLS actually has better attendance than the NHL  but depending on where you live  this may not be obvious.

Growing up i played on/with the best teams and players in my area. When i was a little younger than the cut off date my local MLS team opened up their youth academy (Youth team fully funded by the MLS team to train the best players in the area with the hopes of eventually graduating them to the actual professional team). I played in that academy when i was of age  graduated the academy  played some college ball  and ended up focusing on my degree when i was over Soccer  so i no longer play. I currently do some coaching for that same MLS team and have gotten to take a good look at what their academy is now  and discuss it with other academy graduates from my age and from younger ones who have experienced the changes. It's so much more organized  better run  better coached  has better infrastructure  just better everything  and really sets up their players for success in Soccer or otherwise. As someone who currently coaches and was actually a part of the system that is looking to produce players who will be able to compete on the international level  the day isn't too far in the future when we'll see our national team improve  based on what i've seen at least. I highly doubt we're going to be winning world cups in the foreseeable future  but i think with every world cup possibly after this next one we're going to see tangible improvements.  There's still a plethora of other problems with US youth Soccer (the monetary cost of playing  incompetent coaches  college Soccer)  but the MLS academy teams are a massive step in the right direction.  TL/DR: Infrastructure for Soccer is complicated  takes time to get in place. As someone who has a unique inside view of the exact system that is the base for a better national team  it's looking good and the next 10 years should be an exciting time for US men's Soccer  but still keep in mind countries like England  France  Germany  Portugal  Netherlands  etc have had much sturdier infrastructure for Soccer for a much longer time and it will take time to bring ourselves level.",,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.1802696793002915,92004,

In other countries the big clubs of that country usually foot the bill for youth development in their in club development schools. Literally a school that is half school half soccer that you go and live at when you reach the right age. In the US the parents foot the entire bill for youth development. It automatically removes anyone unable to pay from getting that development they need. In a world sport where other countries are developing their youth as early as 8 to be a first team player we are not even close. There is probably 300 kids right now between the ages of 8-14 who could be international players and some of them super stars but we will never know because they don't have the money for youth development. Almost all of the recruiting comes from these youth camps in the US because of that. If a kid is 16-17-18 in high school (unless he is just unreal at the game) he is already too old for prime development in the eyes of the rest of the world. We just don't have the same pride in the game other countries do and we have monetized the wrong aspect of the game. Big clubs use youth as a future pay check whether with the player producing at their club or trades  but in the US we monetized the players right now instead of later.  In some places things have started to change but not fast enough and not enough MLS clubs doing their part to fix the problem. US men's soccer still has a very long way to go. Doesn't help that US soccer has made a lot  I mean a lot of poor choices in their leadership for the men's team in recent years.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",-0.06173510313216196,92043,

There’s also the optics of the situation which my college is right to keep tight tabs on.  We don’t have men’s soccer or men’s (or women’s) golf. We had a coed golf team for a while but not sure how that worked or what happened to it. Not sure about the current tennis situation.  Edit: not arguing against Title IX just wish the exceptions were a little better explored. Even if my college only got 80 scholarships for each sex it would mean that 39% of the women were on a scholarship which does weird things to the way women are perceived in the corps of cadets and to recruiting in general.

Berhalter completely threw that game and showed little to no tactical awareness. First  his subs were atrocious. I am going to give him the benefit of the doubt with Roldan for Morris and assume Boyd has an injury. Zardes is a mess and is shown clear favoritism (Sargent didn’t die for this) and came in for Altidore who was having a great game so far. Finally  why the hell did Berhalter think that being a goal down it was a good idea to sub in Lovitz (defender) in the 80th minute. That sub should have happened 10 minutes into the half not 10 minutes before it ended. Berhalter did nothing to address the tactical changes Mexico made at half.   2. It wasn’t all just the US being bad though. I thought Mexico was the better team in the second half and Tata  Martino the much better coach. His changes of switching Pizarro to the other side against Ream and Bradley who were slow and terrible defensively paid off and having Pulisic man marked immediately swayed the game in their favor. Also great finish by Santos.  3. I thought Long  Pulisic  Cannon and Altidore has good performances. Bradley  Ream and Zardes were terrible and probably should never be starters ever again.  I’m not sure why Boyd wasn’t starting over Morris but I’ll just assume injury.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",-0.0654079861111111,92101,

The problem with Altidore is that his ball skills have been terrible the past  what  8 years?  he doesn't play defense  and he botches possession WAY too much.  He plays terrible with his back to goal  and he best use is being served the ball in a counter/breakaway format.  These plays happen so little and the speed of the rest of the world is such that it's a relatively ineffective strategy when trying to score goals in a tough men's soccer world.  I can't say that Zardes is much better  but he's at least better and more formation aware to find better spaces and perhaps play the 2 vs the defense better.  think how much different the game would've been if Altidore could shoot with his left foot....he had left post wide open AND he had the right post wide open  but his shot  particularly in slow motion  showed a middle school kid trying to kick with his off leg.  Like  this guy has spent close to 8 years on the national team...HOW in the world is his left foot THAT BAD?!?,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.0068919234360410786,92193,

The biggest thing is that the US soccer is directly linked to keeping a womens league growing here in the states. They fund a largely profit losing endeavor  so the women can play here and try and grow the league. The salary paid to women in the league is paid by us soccer  unlike the MLS. The US women get (I might not be right on the nose accurate) 14% of the world cup profits which is expected to be around 132 million. The US men get paid only 7% but where the huge difference resides is that the world cup in russia generated close to 6 Billion. There are just so many moving parts on both sides it's going to be interesting to see how it all pans out.

Since 1998  they have gone out in the Ro16 to:   Germany   USA   Argentina   Argentina again   Netherlands   Brazil.   The only one there that you could say they are supposed to beat is the USA.

But if the sweeper doesnt come up to defend the freely streaking ball carrier  the result is almost assuredly a goal...which it was.

The defender tries to lure her closer and more to the right side of the pitch.  Lavelle does everything right in this situation and exploids the lack of support for the defender. Dribbles in  misleads with a movement to the right but a run to the centre  and finishes brilliantly. The Dutch defence could have done some things better    1.Don't lose the ball when switching from defense to attack   2.Miedema could have shadowed more aggresively so Lavelle wouldn't have all options open   3. The left back chooses to help the centre quite late (I prefer a shot from the side to a shot from the centre)   4. The centre back might could have forced Lavelle in every situation to the right side by leaving even more space there(now she has to make a rotation and loses all oversight and control from that moment),,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.17460317460317462,92394,

Headbutting  groin punching and hair pulling was still legal though :D  and the king of the hill part was apparently another brain fart of mine  I wasn't sure what it was called lol.   But anyways  they would have to fight & win 3 fights in a night to become champs.  in 1997 Weight classes were added for the first time. it was UFC 12,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.2607142857142857,92538,

As someone mentioned earlier  much of the damage done to a fighters brain is the subconcussive blows done over a number of years in training and practice fights. As far as I know they are now trying to train smarter (not as many hard training sessions as frequently as 20 years ago) where they basically fought with headgear. These types of hit tend to be noticeable and will have people acting and feeling off for weeks at least (sometimes longer)  with chances at long term damage. So in a fighter that already has multiple subconcussive damages over years  the effects can be more pronounced.  There seems to be a tipping point for fighters after a bad knock out or two where they lose their ""chin"" and lose the ability to takrs hits they could have in their younger years.

His training regimen consisted of running and kneeing the air everyday for hours  carefully perfecting the technique and instilling muscle memory. He kneed banana trees  bones  then concrete walls to develop pain tolerance and toughened skin. In his spare time Masvidal used his knee instead of his hammer while fixing his home. Right before bed time he rolled his knee in oats  massaged it then tenderly kissed it goodnight.   The team formulated a complex plan  measuring the cage of the venue and taking into account details such as the most efficient number of steps to take before landing the knee. Masvidal’s seemingly impatient bounces on the cage served as a method of gathering rapid momentum for the sprint. To know his opponent  Masdival consumed every fight video of Askren  slept in Askren’s childhood room  had a pleasant conversation with Askren’s mother and slept with Askren’s exes. Truly  he became Askren.   All that work paid off as when the moment arrived  Masdival executed the plan to perfection while all predictions came true  and by God was it a sight to behold.

NFL is way worse for many reasons. I'll name a couple.  Practice: you hit head to head constantly. Smaller hits: constant small trauma without time off.   It isn't the WR and QBs taking a huge shot every couple games that have CTE. It is the linemen who take smaller hits constantly. This is also why boxers have such bad CTE. Years of practice hitting eachother in 50% sparring.   Years and years of practice. Years of hits to the head. NFL and boxing. It is the culmination of strikes that causes CTE.

And that $3 million is as the probable biggest draw in MMA and UFC history.

Guy punches him  he goes limp and you see his arms drop and he's no longer defending himself (no longer intelligently defending is a common reason for the ref to stop  the fight)  he gets punched again a split second later and it seems to wake him up again and he begins defending and turns out winning the fight.  So yeah a knock out like last night you aren't waking up  but he did seem to temporarily be out then be woken up by a 2nd punch. Was weird.

The penalty kick felt anti-climatic  and reminded me how frustrating soccer is to my American sports sensibilities.   Alex Morgan and the Dutch defender were both looking up at the ball  and Alex Morgan ran into her already outstretched leg. It was the Right Call  I am told. Even so  it was still a close-call  as evidenced by the referees consulting the replay.   The match was basically over after that. Nederlands looked deflated  and they quickly gave up another goal quickly. It could easily have been 2 or 3 more goals.   Credit to USA for being the better team  but overall it made for an anti-climatic viewing experience for me as a fan who is actively looking for a new sport to watch after getting fed up with the NFL blackballing Kaepernick.  Penalties are too easy to get  and too costly. A penalty kick is converted 80% of the time! That's like a free-throw in basketball  except a goal in soccer is worth the equivalent of 40-50 points in basketball. It incentives flopping  and throws off the entire game theory calculus. If Kawhi Leonard had taken a free throw worth 40 points midway through the 4th quarter of Game 7 of the NBA finals  I would just turn the TV off and feel robbed of a good game as a casual fan.   Obviously  the majority of the world loves the game just as it is  but as a sport it just seems unfair to have games heavily influenced or decided by plays like that. I've watched 15-20 matches in my life. I want to love soccer  but the viewing experience is frustrating to my casual fan American sports sensibilities.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.059045524368105,92927,

She likely knew the goalie knew that. They (GK's) study tendencies for this stuff in detail. Now  on this one  she got the goalkeeper to bite that way and just slotted it the other direction. So  it was not a bad penalty. I mean  by default it's not  since it went in. But more than that  this wasn't luck or anything like that. Yes that ball was ""save-able"" if the goalie had gone the other way  but Rapinoe shot it where the goalie wasn't. That's called a good penalty. Not every penalty needs to be a perfect rocket to a top corner to be ""good""  especially when you have GK who is as good as NED's is.

So if everyone's cars are subject to the same limitations and all have the best products and mechanics why are there standouts like Dale Earnhardt  Jeff Gordon  Kyle Busch  etc?

There are three referees out there already  and adding a film replay on all these plays removes the human element from the game.  As I've said elsewhere in this thread  it's called the *beautiful game* not the *""technically that's the correct call""* game.  Edit: also  you can't even see for sure on the replays! For example on the English flicked through ball against the US - it's impossible to see if the ball is actually on her foot at the moment they freeze the play to make a call. The margins are too close  let the play stand as it looks in live action. VAR in its current form is total bullshit.  Edit 2 - bring the downvotes if you must  but I'd love to see somebody tell me why and how VAR improved these two games.

You’d speed up the game quite a bit if you just let them make calls.

And the problems a vocal (to the point of terrorism) minority pushing for those beliefs bring.   Despite some relatively minute cultural differences  and that history. The Irish English  Scotch  Welsh  and however far you want to keep dividing up your country have a lot more in common than you do in differences.   Trust me we have similar problems here in the U.S. with some of our more radical parts of the country. Shit it's basically a natural problem for long lived diverse countries to experience  and 9 times out of ten all parties are better off together. But there are cases like with Spain where the Catalans have a more legitimate argument than most for self determination.

Clearly the Swedish player pushed the English woman's arm into the ball and it had no effect on the balls travel. If it didn't hit the English players arm it would've hit the Swedish players chest and dropped down the same way. But this is more of an idiot ref with a swede bias than an issue /w VAR.    VAR is great for soccer because the diving is so problematic in the men's WC. The refs really need to start actually carding them for embellishment though when VAR exposes it which they didn't in 2018. I just think they didn't want too many people afraid of change crying about it in 2018. I think the reckoning is coming in 2022 for the worst embellishment offending countries (we all know who they are).,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.02688492063492064,93350,

Simply put  this is not new anymore. I believe it will come online in the Premier League next season too.   This issues are really the subjective elements of refereeing at this point. Ultimately this system requires the ref to use good judgment as to when to stop play for review. Before VAR they had to decide immediately if it was a whistle or just play on/advantage  not they have to be able to see the situation on the field and decide if calling back the play is worth it yet or better to wait.   Consider: Team A on defense  player tackles and wins the ball from Team B  Team A counter attacks and scores. During this play VAR notifies the ref (vibrating watch notification) that there is a potential foul to review. So does the ref stop play in the middle of the counter attack and review the tackle for a foul? Or do they let Team A counter and score  then review while play is dead? If they stop play early and it's no foul  Team A loses a good goal scoring chance. If they wait and let the play conclude then review and it is a foul  then they rule out the goal and pull the ball back for a Team B free kick. Now take this dilemma further and imagine a scenario with teams like Barcelona or Manchester City who keep the ball moving without a break for minutes at a time.   TL DR: VAR is a crucial tool for giving referees more information and the ability to miss calls that obstructed or too fast and still implement the laws of the game. Unfortunately the price is a system that interrupts the synchronic beauty of the sport which is one of the hitherto defining features of soccer/football. Ultimately the responsibility lies with the referee to use judgement because they have the unlimited authority to call the game the way they see fit. The challenge is that this is new tech and when it's implemented without finess it shows in a way they detracts from the viewing experience. However if that's the price of making sure offside goals are called correctly 100% of the time  of confirming when the ball crosses the line 100% of the time  or of having effective in game punishment for dirty play  then it's worth it 100% of the time.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.08216783216783216,93426,

Now there's two issues to this  the first being that British colonialism is woefully under-taught in schools  that goes for all colonies  at least that's been my feeling and experience. The second is that in terms of historical significance America plays a pretty small role  especially compared to how critical lots of other colonies were. As a colony the US was pretty inconsequential  they weren't of any great economic value. I believe it is something insane like 80% of the population worked in agriculture (don’t quote me on that)  when compared to the west indies which had immensely successful and rich spice trades and sugar plantations the US wasn’t really noteworthy  there weren’t any major resource deposits like gold found in Latin America. The most well-known thing the US did as a colony was fight for independence  which as the biggest empire the world has ever seen wasn’t exactly novel for British history. In comparison countries like India  Hong Kong  and Australia have been a much bigger part in shaping our modern history.   I can see why you guys across the pond care so much for it  it essentially marked the beginning of your country. Relatively speaking the USA is a new country  it plays a bigger significance in your history proportionally and of importance for Yanks than Brits.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.10174512987012987,93436,

They were not worried about the United Kingdom taking their slaves  especially as many of the founding fathers themselves advocated for the abolition of slavery  and was originally going to be in the Constitution  although many of these men were somewhat hypocritical in their owning of slaves  which may be the reason they so easily dropped the issue. Slavery wasn't part of any of the colonies rhetoric in seceding  and this a time when people really were frankly racist and didn't have a problem with slavery  this would not be attempting to hide this reason. You can see this in the civil war  where many states explicitly stated slavery was the cause of their secession. You're just wrong in this case  Edit: It was also more than the stamp act. The quartering act  which you can see how it affected Americans as one of the amendments of the Bill of Rights forbids this. Then you have the intolerable acts. There are many reasons for the revolution  and your boiling down to slavery and the stamp act shows your ignorance in history. This is not a scenario with one major decisive factor  like slavery and the civil war  but a long running feeling of the colonists that the United Kingdom was not acting in their interests  in more ways than just taxing them.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.2760912698412699,93488,
