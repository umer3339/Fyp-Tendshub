Sure  the decrease of nutrients is not ideal but let's put this into perspective.   A 5.1% drop in iron sounds spooky. Let's take whole wheat for example. 100 g of wheat contains ~3.18 mg of iron  with the 5.1% drop you are now getting 0.16 mgs less. It's a negligible amount  and is unlikely to have any measurable impact on your health. Additionally  iron from plant sources isn't absorbed as efficiently as iron from animal sources  so a well balanced diet will easily make up for this loss.   They mention protein as well  plant protein is already not an ideal source of protein but let's take soy as an example (one of the very few complete plant protein sources). A serving contains ~8g of protein  3% decrease would be a 0.24g difference which is negligible in the grand scheme of your daily intake. On the lower end (most vegetation contains around 3ish g of incomplete protein) you're missing out on a whopping 0.09 grams.

Journal of Transport Geography  Volume 76  2019  Pages 130-141  ISSN 0966-6923   Link: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0966692318307269  DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2019.03.008.  Abstract:   This study is the first of its kind to explore the relationship between commuting behavior and employee productivity by drawing theories from multiple disciplines and providing empirical evidence from Australian cities. Relying on survey data collected from three major cities in Australia  this study finds that commuting distance is positively associated with absenteeism. This study also finds a positive association between active commuting (i.e.  travel to work by walking or bicycling) and job performance in the middle-aged employees. The structural equation model further explored possible causal pathways from commuting to employee productivity  and the results reveal that commuting mode choices and commuting distance influence absenteeism and job performance through affecting commuting satisfaction and personal health  though commuting distance retains a direct impact on absenteeism after controlling for the indirect effects. In particular  the results suggest that the happy commuters are more productive  and the short-distance and active travel commuters are more likely to be the happy commuters. Overall  these findings support that commuting behaviors of employees influence their productivity at the workplace. Encourage active commuting not only improves the physical health of employees  but may also enhance their job performance  contributing to the economic benefits to employers and society.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.16382034632034628,15125,

This might be because of an unhealthy diet  excessive stress  and lack of exercise. Basically  every unhealthy and bad lifestyle habit causes higher build-up inflammatory substances in the body  esp. the brain  since it receives 20% of the body's blood supply. A high sugar intake  thus  affects the brain more than it does to any other organ.

Link: https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2737918  doi:10.1001/jamainternmed.2019.1993  Key Points  Question  Is cannabinoid agonist treatment  in combination with psychosocial services  a safe and efficacious approach to reducing illicit cannabis use in patients with cannabis dependence who are seeking treatment?  Findings  In this randomized clinical trial of 128 participants  a 12-week course of nabiximols  a combination of tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol  resulted in significantly fewer days of illicit cannabis use compared with placebo  and was well tolerated by participants.  Meaning  The use of cannabinoid agonist medication appears to be a promising addition to the treatment of patients with cannabis dependence.  Abstract  Importance  There are no effective medications for treating dependence on cannabis.  Objective  To examine the safety and efficacy of nabiximols in the treatment of patients with cannabis dependence.  Design  Setting  and Participants  This parallel double-blind randomized clinical trial comparing nabiximols with placebo in a 12-week  multisite outpatient study recruited participants from February 3  2016  to June 14  2017  at 4 outpatient specialist alcohol and drug treatment services in New South Wales  Australia. Participants had cannabis dependence (as defined by the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems  Tenth Revision) and were seeking treatment  were nonresponsive to prior treatment attempts  were 18 to 64 years of age  had no other substance use disorder  had no severe medical or psychiatric conditions  were not pregnant  were not mandated by a court to undergo treatment  and provided informed consent. Results for primary efficacy measures and all secondary outcomes were obtained using a modified intention-to-treat data set.  Interventions  Participants received 12-week treatment involving weekly clinical reviews  structured counseling  and flexible medication doses—up to 32 sprays daily (tetrahydrocannabinol  86.4 mg  and cannabidiol  80 mg)  dispensed weekly.  Main Outcomes and Measures  Primary outcome was self-reported number of days using illicit cannabis during the 12-week period. Other outcomes included alternate cannabis use parameters (periods of abstinence  withdrawal  cravings  and problems)  safety parameters (adverse events and aberrant medication use)  health status  other substance use  and treatment retention.  Results  A total of 128 participants (30 women and 98 men; mean [SD] age  35.0 [10.9] years) were randomized and received at least 1 dose of study medication. Participants had used a mean (SD) of 2.3 (2.1) g of cannabis on a mean (SD) of 25.7 (4.5) days in the past 28 days. Treatment retention was comparable for the 2 groups (placebo  30 of 67 participants [44.8%]; nabiximols  30 of 61 participants [49.2%])  and both groups used similar mean (SD) doses (placebo  18.5 [9.5] sprays daily; nabiximols  17.6 [9.5] sprays daily  equivalent to a mean [SD] of 47.5 [25.7] mg of tetrahydrocannabinol and 44.0 [23.8] mg of cannabidiol). For the primary end point  the placebo group reported significantly more days using cannabis during the 12 weeks (mean [SD]  53.1 [33.0] days) than the nabiximols group (mean [SD]  35.0 [32.4] days; estimated difference  18.6 days; 95% CI  3.5-33.7 days; P = .02).

In the present study  using single-cell analysis  it was shown that HIV-specific  central memory CD8+ T cells from spontaneous HIV controllers (HICs) and antiretrovirally treated non-controllers have opposing transcriptomic profiles. Genes linked to effector functions and survival are upregulated in cells from HICs. In contrast  genes associated with activation  exhaustion and glycolysis are upregulated in cells from non-controllers. It was shown that HIV-specific CD8+ T cells from non-controllers are largely glucose dependent  whereas those from HICs have more diverse metabolic resources that enhance both their survival potential and their capacity to develop anti-HIV effector functions. The functional efficiency of the HIV-specific CD8+ T cell response in HICs is thus engraved in their memory population and related to their metabolic programme. Metabolic reprogramming in vitro through interleukin-15 treatment abrogated the glucose dependency and enhanced the antiviral potency of HIV-specific CD8+ T cells from non-controllers.",,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.20718125960061445,15163,0.064

(2019)    Trends in Non‐Hispanic White Mortality in the United States by Metropolitan‐Nonmetropolitan Status and Region  1990–2016.   Population and Development Review.   Link: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/padr.12249  doi:10.1111/padr.12249  Introduction:  The first decades of the twenty‐first century have been a challenging period for American mortality. Life expectancy in the United States ranked 30th in the world in 2010 and is much lower than in other high‐income countries (World Health Organization 2017). Between 2010 and 2016  US life expectancy fell further behind other developed countries  increasing by only 0.08 years  the smallest 5‐year increase since 1970 (Ho and Hendi 2018). These relatively slow mortality declines occurred against a background in which US mortality in the 1990s and 2000s was already high by the standards of other OECD countries (Ho and Preston 2010; Crimmins et al. 2011; Ho 2013; Institute of Medicine and National Research Council 2013; Palloni and Yonker 2016). At the same time  there have been large and growing geographic and socioeconomic inequalities in health and mortality within the United States (Fenelon 2013; Wang et al. 2013; Hendi 2015  2017; Chetty et al. 2016; Montez  Sasson  and Hayward 2016a).  Several recent studies of the national‐level mortality stagnation have documented adverse mortality trends among middle‐aged non‐Hispanic whites (Kochanek  Arias  and Bastian 2016a; Squires and Blumenthal 2016; Case and Deaton 2017)  particularly among women (Astone  Martin  and Aron 2015; Gelman and Auerbach 2016; Kochanek et al. 2016b) and those with lower levels of education (Hendi 2017) and income (Chetty et al. 2016). Case and Deaton (2015  2017) drew attention to the role that “deaths of despair”—consisting of accidental poisoning (linked to the epidemic of prescription opioids and heroin)  suicide  and chronic liver disease—play in mortality increases among non‐Hispanic whites. Elevated mortality from these causes of death is especially concentrated among individuals with low levels of education (see also Ho 2017; Kochanek et al. 2016b). However  these “deaths of despair” cannot fully explain the slowdown in mortality declines  since the adverse trends persist even after eliminating mortality from these causes (Squires and Blumenthal 2016; Monnat 2018; Rigg  Monnat  and Chavez 2018). Other causes of death are also hypothesized to be important contributors to stagnating mortality declines. Case and Deaton (2017) show that between 1999 and 2015  declines in cardiovascular disease and cancer mortality at ages 50–54 were relatively slow among non‐Hispanic whites in the United States compared to other OECD countries. One study estimates that rising obesity has reduced the annual rate of decline in US death rates at ages 40–84 by 0.5–0.6 percentage points between 1986 and 2011 (Preston  Vierboom  and Stokes 2018).  A parallel literature has highlighted widening geographic inequalities in mortality in the period leading up to the recent mortality stagnation. Mortality improvements in Appalachia and the South  particularly the East South Central Division  have lagged behind other regions (Fenelon 2013; Wang et al. 2013)  a pattern that has been partly linked to behavioral risk factors such as smoking and obesity (Fenelon 2013; Singh and Siahpush 2014; Dwyer‐Lindgren et al. 2016; Dwyer‐Lindgren et al. 2017; Mokdad et al. 2017; Roth et al. 2017). Trends in all‐cause and cause‐specific mortality rates have also varied considerably among US states (Chetty et al. 2016; Montez  Sasson  and Hayward 2016a) and counties (Ezzati et al. 2008; Dwyer‐Lindgren et al. 2016; Roth et al. 2017). These studies typically find that although some counties  states  and regions have experienced improvements in life expectancy  others have experienced more moderate gains or even declines over the past few decades (Murray et al. 2006; Cullen  Cummins  and Fuchs 2012; Wang et al. 2013; Chetty et al. 2016).  Other studies have documented widening mortality differences between metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas since the 1980s (Cosby et al. 2008; Cossman et al. 2010; James 2014; James and Cossman 2017; Moy et al. 2017). Singh and Siahpush (2014) examined data through 2009 and found that rural  nonmetropolitan areas made slower progress in life expectancy in the preceding decades than urban  metropolitan areas. More recently  Stein et al. (2017) focused on mortality trends at ages 25–64 between 1999 and 2015 by age  race/ethnicity  cause of death  and level of urbanization. They documented increasing death rates for non‐Hispanic whites  mainly outside large urban areas  with suicide  poisoning  and liver disease contributing to these adverse trends. Death rates were the highest in rural areas for all racial/ethnic groups. Similarly  James and Cossman (2017) documented growing urban‐rural disparities in age‐adjusted mortality rates for both whites and Blacks since the mid‐1980s. Percent poor  region  and emergency room visits and medical doctors per 1 000 were significant predictors of age‐adjusted death rates among whites in most metropolitan‐nonmetropolitan subcategories in 2012  but not among Blacks  suggesting that factors that predict the metropolitan‐nonmetropolitan mortality disparities vary by race/ethnicity.  In this article  we build on this prior research by providing a comprehensive examination of trends in non‐Hispanic white mortality between 1990 and 2016 by metropolitan‐nonmetropolitan status and region. Prior studies have often focused on finer levels of geographic variation  for example  counties or states  whereas our study examines 40 different geographic areas consisting of 10 broad geographic regions cross‐classified by four metropolitan‐nonmetropolitan categories. This cross‐classification allows us to incorporate the substantial amount of variation within states (e.g.  across metro‐nonmetro categories) while identifying shared factors at the regional level that may be driving mortality trends. We focus on non‐Hispanic whites because their mortality trends were particularly adverse in the last decade and differ from those of non‐Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics. In contrast to non‐Hispanic whites  mortality has continued to decline among Hispanics and non‐Hispanic Blacks  although death rates remain substantially higher for Blacks than for whites (Harper  MacLehose  and Kaufman 2014; Murphy et al. 2017; Stein et al. 2017). The underlying mechanisms driving mortality trends for non‐Hispanic whites are fundamentally different from those driving trends for other racial/ethnic groups  as suggested by James and Cossman (2017). Thus  we limit the scope of this article to non‐Hispanic whites.  This article is an effort to unite the literature on adverse mortality trends among non‐Hispanic whites at the national level with the literature on growing geographic inequalities in mortality. Our goals are to carefully document life expectancy trends in each of the 40 geographic areas described above  building upon previous research in several ways. First  we extend analyses to 2016 and include all age groups. Second  we estimate the contributions of four key age groups to changes in life expectancy at birth between 1990 and 2016 by metropolitan‐nonmetropolitan status and region. Third  we examine the contribution of 14 broad  cause of death categories to these changes  highlighting categories that are strongly linked to behavioral factors and access to health care. In the Discussion section  we consider several potential explanations of the patterns we describe.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.04344461697722568,15164,0.0

Link: https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2737902  doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2019.7025   Key Points  Question  Is prenatal opioid exposure associated with differences in childhood cognitive and motor development?  Findings  In this systematic review and meta-analysis of 26 studies including 1455 children exposed to prenatal opioids compared with unexposed children  prenatal opioid exposure was associated with lower cognitive scores. The largest difference was seen between ages 6 months and 6 years.  Meaning  The negative consequences of prenatal opioid exposure on neurocognitive and physical development appear to be present from 6 months and persist beyond school age.  Abstract  Importance  Prenatal opioid exposure (POE) is one of the fastest-growing global health problems  but its association with long-term neurologic and physical development remains unknown.  Objective  To assess the association between POE and cognitive and motor development in children from age 6 months to 18 years.  Data Sources  Key search terms included prenatal opioid exposure  neonatal abstinence syndrome  and neurocognitive development. Studies were searched using PubMed and Embase  with no publication date restriction  through August 20  2018.  Study Selection  Only published cohort studies comparing the results of age-appropriate standardized cognitive and/or motor tests between children with any POE (aged 0-18 years) with drug-free controls were included. Data that were not convertible to means and SDs were excluded.  Data Extraction and Synthesis  This study was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) and Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines. Data were pooled using a random-effects model.  Main Outcomes and Measures  Standardized mean difference of cognitive and motor tests between POE and nonexposed children.  Results  Twenty-six peer-reviewed cohort studies were included. Cognitive outcomes were compared for a total of 1455 children with POE and 2982 nonexposed children across 3 age groups (mean [SE] age at cognitive testing was 13 [1.58] months for the toddler group; 4.5 [0.38] years for the preschool group; and 13 [2.36] years for the school-aged group). Motor outcomes were compared for 688 children with POE and 1500 nonexposed children up to age 6 years (mean [SD] age at motor testing  2 [0.45] years). Standardized mean difference was lower in cognitive tests for children with POE at 0 to 2 years (d = −0.52; 95% CI  −0.74 to −0.31; P < .001) and 3 to 6 years (d = −0.38; 95% CI  −0.69 to −0.07; P < .001); the difference was not significant for those aged 7 to 18 years (d = −0.44; 95% CI  −1.16 to 0.28; P = .23). Motor scores were lower in children with POE (d = 0.49; 95% CI  0.23-0.74; P < .001).  Conclusions and Relevance  Prenatal opioid exposure appeared to be negatively associated with neurocognitive and physical development from age 6 months  and this association persisted until adolescence. The cause and association of this with POE or other factors (eg  withdrawal treatment) are uncertain but suggest that POE necessitates long-term support and intervention.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",-0.0050781250000000045,15341,-0.199

Link: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0219065  DOI: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0219065  Abstract  Background  Few randomized controlled trials have assessed the effects of laughter therapy on health-related quality of life (QOL) in cancer patients. This study aimed to evaluate these effects as an exploratory endpoint in cancer patients as part of a randomized controlled trial conducted at a single institution in Japan.  Methods  The Initiative On Smile And CAncer (iOSACA) study was an open-label randomized controlled trial conducted in 2017 in which participants aged 40–64 years with cancer were randomly assigned to either an intervention group (laughter therapy) or control group (no laughter therapy). Each participant in the intervention group underwent a laughter therapy session once every two weeks for seven weeks (total of four sessions). Each session involved a laughter yoga routine followed by Rakugo or Manzai traditional Japanese verbal comedy performances. We assessed QOL as a secondary endpoint in this intention-to-treat population using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30). The questionnaire was completed at baseline (Week 0) and at Weeks 3 and 7. Mixed-effects models for repeated measures were developed to compare time-dependent changes in each QOL domain from baseline between the intervention and control groups.  Results  Four participants retracted consent and one participant was retrospectively excluded from analysis due to unmet inclusion criteria. The analysis was conducted using 56 participants  with 26 in the intervention group and 30 in the control group. Questionnaire completion rates were high (>90%)  with similar QOL scores reported at baseline in both groups. The mixed-effects models showed that the intervention group had significantly better cognitive function and less pain than the control group for a short period.  Conclusion  Laughter therapy may represent a beneficial  noninvasive complementary intervention in the clinical setting. Further studies are needed to verify the hypotheses generated from this exploratory study.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.015768398268398282,15449,0.092

Intravascular innate immune cells reprogrammed via intravenous nanoparticles to promote functional recovery after spinal cord injury.   Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences  2019; 201820276   Link: https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/07/02/1820276116  DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1820276116  Significance  Inflammatory responses  such as those following spinal cord injury (SCI)  lead to extensive tissue damage that impairs function. Here  we present nanoparticles that target circulating immune cells acutely  with nanoparticles reprogramming the immune cell response. The polymeric nanoparticles are formed without an active pharmaceutical ingredient that can have off-target effects  and internalization redirects some immune cells to the spleen  with modest numbers at the SCI. Following intravenous delivery  immune cell infiltration is reduced  correlating with decreased tissue degeneration. Furthermore  the SCI develops into a permissive microenvironment characterized by proregenerative immune cell phenotypes  expression of regeneration associated genes  increased axons and myelination  and a substantially improved functional recovery. These nanoparticles may be applied to numerous inflammatory diseases.  Abstract  Traumatic primary spinal cord injury (SCI) results in paralysis below the level of injury and is associated with infiltration of hematogenous innate immune cells into the injured cord. Methylprednisolone has been applied to reduce inflammation following SCI  yet was discontinued due to an unfavorable risk-benefit ratio associated with off-target effects. In this study  i.v. administered poly(lactide-coglycolide) nanoparticles were internalized by circulating monocytes and neutrophils  reprogramming these cells based on their physicochemical properties and not by an active pharmaceutical ingredient  to exhibit altered biodistribution  gene expression  and function. Approximately 80% of nanoparticle-positive immune cells were observed within the injury  and  additionally  the overall accumulation of innate immune cells at the injury was reduced 4-fold  coinciding with down-regulated expression of proinflammatory factors and increased expression of antiinflammatory and proregenerative genes. Furthermore  nanoparticle administration induced macrophage polarization toward proregenerative phenotypes at the injury and markedly reduced both fibrotic and gliotic scarring 3-fold. Moreover  nanoparticle administration with the implanted multichannel bridge led to increased numbers of regenerating axons  increased myelination with about 40% of axons myelinated  and an enhanced locomotor function (score of 6 versus 3 for control group). These data demonstrate that nanoparticles provide a platform that limits acute inflammation and tissue destruction  at a favorable risk-benefit ratio  leading to a proregenerative microenvironment that supports regeneration and functional recovery. These particles may have applications to trauma and potentially other inflammatory diseases.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.051238095238095235,15460,

Lancet Oncology  Published:July 09  2019  Link: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(19)30340-7/fulltext  DOI:https://doi.org/10.1016/S1470-2045(19)30340-7  Summary  Background  Various factors—including age  family history  inflammation  reproductive factors  and tubal ligation—modulate the risk of ovarian cancer. In this study  our aim was to establish whether women with  or at risk of developing  ovarian cancer have an imbalanced cervicovaginal microbiome.  Methods  We did a case-control study in two sets of women aged 18–87 years in the Czech Republic  Germany  Italy  Norway  and the UK. The ovarian cancer set comprised women with epithelial ovarian cancer and controls (both healthy controls and those diagnosed with benign gynaecological conditions). The BRCA set comprised women with a BRCA1 mutation but without ovarian cancer and controls who were wild type for BRCA1 and BRCA2 (both healthy controls and those with benign gynaecological conditions). Cervicovaginal samples were gathered from all participants with the ThinPrep system and then underwent 16S rRNA gene sequencing. For each sample  we calculated the proportion of lactobacilli species (ie  Lactobacillus crispatus  Lactobacillus iners  Lactobacillus gasseri  and Lactobacillus jensenii)  which are essential for the generation of a protective low vaginal pH  in the cervicovaginal microbiota. We grouped samples into those in which lactobacilli accounted for at least 50% of the species present (community type L) and those in which lactobacilli accounted for less than 50% of the species present (community type O). We assessed the adjusted association between BRCA1 status and ovarian cancer status and cervicovaginal microbiota community type  using a logistic regression model with a bias reduction method.  Findings  Participants were recruited between Jan 2  2016  and July 21  2018. The ovarian cancer set (n=360) comprised 176 women with epithelial ovarian cancer  115 healthy controls and 69 controls with benign gynaecological conditions. The BRCA set (n=220) included 109 women with BRCA1 mutations  97 healthy controls wild type for BRCA1 and BRCA2 and 14 controls with a benign gynaecological condition wild type for BRCA1 and BRCA2. On the basis of two-dimensional density plots  receiver–operating characteristic curve analysis  and age thresholds used previously  we divided the cohort into those younger than 50 years and those aged 50 years or older. In the ovarian cancer set  women aged 50 years or older had a higher prevalence of community type O microbiota (81 [61%] of 133 ovarian cancer cases and 84 [59%] of 142 healthy controls) than those younger than 50 years (23 [53%] of 43 cases and 12 [29%] of 42 controls). In the ovarian cancer set  women younger than 50 years with ovarian cancer had a significantly higher prevalence of community type O microbiota than did age-matched controls under a logistic regression model with bias correction (odds ratio [OR] 2·80 [95% CI 1·17–6·94]; p=0·020). In the BRCA set  women with BRCA1 mutations younger than 50 years were also more likely to have community type O microbiota than age-matched controls (OR 2·79 [95% CI 1·25–6·68]; p=0·012)  after adjustment for pregnancy (ever). This risk was increased further if more than one first-degree family member was affected by any cancer (OR 5·26 [95% CI 1·83–15·30]; p=0·0022). In both sets  we noted that the younger the participants  the stronger the association between community type O microbiota and ovarian cancer or BRCA1 mutation status (eg  OR for community type O for cases aged <40 years in the ovarian cancer set 7·00 [95% CI 1·27–51·44]  p=0·025; OR for community type O for BRCA1 mutation carriers aged <35 years in the BRCA set 4·40 [1·14–24·36]  p=0·031).  Interpretation  The presence of ovarian cancer  or factors known to affect risk for the disease (ie  age and BRCA1 germline mutations)  were significantly associated with having a community type O cervicovaginal microbiota. Whether re-instatement of a community type L microbiome by using  for example  vaginal suppositories containing live lactobacilli  would alter the microbiomial composition higher up in the female genital tract and in the fallopian tubes (the site of origin of high-grade serous ovarian cancer)  and whether such changes could translate into a reduced incidence of ovarian cancer  needs to be investigated.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.11204384268214056,15471,-0.052

A diet of mainly sweet fruits will damage your liver  regardless if you think it is healthy or not.Also it is not a big leap it is documented by several studies like [this one](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3649103/).  >Most people consider sugar (i.e.  fructose-containing compounds) to be  just “empty calories.” However  this paper reports 3 separate ways that  fructose exerts negative effects beyond its caloric equivalent. First   in the hypercaloric state  fructose drives DNL  resulting in  dyslipidemia  hepatic steatosis  and insulin resistance  akin to that  seen with ethanol. This should not be surprising because fructose and  ethanol are congruent evolutionarily and biochemically. Ethanol is  manufactured by the fermentation of fructose — the big difference is  that for ethanol  the yeast performs the glycolysis  whereas for  fructose  we humans perform our own glycolysis. Second  through  production of reactive carbonyl moieties  both fructose and ethanol  generate excess ROS  which increases the risk of hepatocellular damage  if not quenched by antioxidants. Last  by downregulation of D2  receptors in the reward pathway  chronic fructose exposure contributes  to a paradigm of continuous food intake independent of energy need and  exerts symptoms of tolerance and withdrawal  similar to chronic ethanol  abuse.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.175,15558,

These new compounds are well tolerated at their active doses – and even beyond – and are devoid of the renal toxicity issues often encountered with this type of compound. “We tested them at doses 10 to 50 times higher than the effective dose without seeing toxicity” specifies Felden  adding that “the participation and imagination of the team and our chemist colleagues was needed to devise the most active molecules possible”.

Novel antibiotics effective against gram-positive and -negative multi-resistant bacteria with limited resistance.   PLOS Biology  2019; 17 (7): e3000337   Link: https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000337  DOI: 10.1371/journal.pbio.3000337  Abstract  Antibiotics are a medical wonder  but an increasing frequency of resistance among most human pathogens is rendering them ineffective. If this trend continues  the consequences for public health and for the general community could be catastrophic. The current clinical pipeline  however  is very limited and is dominated by derivatives of established classes  the “me too” compounds. Here  we have exploited our recent identification of a bacterial toxin to transform it into antibiotics active on multidrug-resistant (MDR) gram-positive and -negative bacterial pathogens. We generated a new family of peptidomimetics—cyclic heptapseudopeptides—inspired from a natural bacterial peptide. Out of the 4 peptides studied  2 are effective against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in mild and severe sepsis mouse models without exhibiting toxicity on human erythrocytes and kidney cells  zebrafish embryos  and mice. These new compounds are safe at their active doses and above  without nephrotoxicity. Efficacy was also demonstrated against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and MRSA in a mouse skin infection model. Importantly  these compounds did not result in resistance after serial passages for 2 weeks and 4 or 6 days’ exposure in mice. Activity of heptapseudopeptides was explained by the ability of unnatural amino acids to strengthen dynamic association with bacterial lipid bilayers and to induce membrane permeability  leading to bacterial death. Based on structure determination  we showed that cationic domains surrounded by an extended hydrophobic core could improve bactericidal activity. Because 2 peptide analogs  Pep 16 and Pep19  are effective against both MRSA and P. aeruginosa in severe sepsis and skin infection models  respectively  we believe that these peptidomimetics are promising lead candidates for drug development. We have identified potential therapeutic agents that can provide alternative treatments against antimicrobial resistance. Because the compounds are potential leads for therapeutic development  the next step is to start phase I clinical trials.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.10219998580654316,15580,

If you are constrained by existing structures  than you can not move past them.  For instance  an arguement can be made that you are all of your life experiences  which means you are made up of all that you know  and so by extension all that you do not know.  Which means a part of yourself must be destroyed in order for you to learn  and thus  the most important (to you) lessons you learn also tend to be the most painful.    This is how human beings evolved  we started off knowing nothing  and we tried a way of life  and it worked.  The next generation came  and said ""this sucks  we must try another way""  and so on.  We didnt know the better way existed  we just looked for the negatives in our current lifestyles and traditions  our way of life  and decided to challenge them.  Ie LGBTQ is challenging the churchs view on homosexuality and we have no idea how that will turn out.

He would even risk his cakes and would deliberately desire the most fatal rubbish  the most uneconomical absurdity  simply to introduce into all this positive good sense his fatal fantastic element. lt is just his fantastic dreams  his vulgar folly that he will desire to retain  simply in order to prove to himself […] that men still are men and not the keys of a piano  which the laws of nature threaten to control so completely that soon one will be able to desire nothing but by the calendar.

Spiritual  social  and physical exercise can reduce your risk factors for all of these. Dieting  exercise and good sleep patterns are all key factors in a healthy life. Good hygiene  especially dental hygiene and avoiding smoking are the other prime risk factors.   I mention spiritual exercise not to trigger atheists. I mention it because atheists who meditate  go out and enjoy nature and who have a sense of wonder and gratitude about life are going to get all the benefits of religious people without the dogma. A good example of that kind of person would be Carl Sagan. I am not sure Carl used meditation in the formal sense  but his wonder at the universe and all it contains was pretty obvious.    The point is many of the people who simply “try harder” wind up with depression and anxiety.  Having something positive to do or some people who share a desire to be more than you are capable of on your own is far more productive then just not doing something. The more you think about not smoking or not eating too much  the more likely you are to engage in those behaviors.

It’s extremely common like 1/4 of Americans develop these problems. I’m only 28 and I’ve had low energy/ dry skin for what seems like years now. Doctors have a hard time diagnosing fatty liver so a blood test or full panel won’t always help.  You must understand your liver filters almost all toxins and everything that goes through the body. When consuming any amount of alcohol  your liver drops everything to filter this harmful toxin.  Your liver is the ONLY organ that can completely heal itself unless too many scars have developed over time. The problem is  it takes nearly 48 hours to filter the alcohol and other toxins (drugs  poor diet) through  Rather than drinking less alcohol everyday  to save your liver  take extended breaks from drinking (easier said than done when your 21). Take a few days off as much as possible and follow these holistic methods  1.	Get some trusted “Milk Thistle” supplements. Follow the instructions on days when you decide to take a break. Always be looking for harmful side effects.  2.	exercise 3.	add more cruciferous vegetables like broccoli  Brussel sprouts  kale and watercress. 4.	add omega 3 fatty acids from quality foods like nuts  eggs  fish and a avocados  5.	Vitamin B  6.	Sounds crazy but breath  relax  be nice to others and truly don’t stress about problems in your life. No sense in having problems that ruin your health. 7.	edit: Try intermittent fasting! Decrease the amount of times per day you eat to 1 or 2 if possible and drink plenty of water.    Many other ways to improve this health but I wish I had followed this advice a few years ago because I went through a period of high sensitively and anger and I was tired and sad  my hands were swollen and in pain and I couldn’t figure it out,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",-0.05359375,15678,

Link: https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/article-abstract/2737637  doi:10.1001/jamapediatrics.2019.1720  Abstract:   In the United States  33 states and the District of Columbia have passed medical marijuana laws (MMLs)  while 10 states and the District of Columbia have legalized the recreational use of marijuana. Policy makers are particularly concerned that legalization for either medicinal or recreational purposes will encourage marijuana use among youth. Repeated marijuana use during adolescence may lead to long-lasting changes in brain function that adversely affect educational  professional  and social outcomes.",,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.13014354066985642,15687,

Increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations could make adverse exposures more frequent and prolonged through increases in indoor air concentrations and increased time spent indoors. **We review preliminary evidence concerning the potential health risks of chronic exposure to environmentally relevant elevations in ambient CO2  including inflammation  reductions in higher-level cognitive abilities  bone demineralization  kidney calcification  oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction. This early evidence indicates potential health risks at CO2 exposures as low as 1 000 ppm—a threshold that is already exceeded in many indoor environments with increased room occupancy and reduced building ventilation rates ** and equivalent to some estimates for urban outdoor air concentrations before 2100. Continuous exposure to increased atmospheric CO2 could be an overlooked stressor of the modern and/or future environment. Further research is needed to quantify the major sources of CO2 exposure  to identify mitigation strategies to avoid adverse health effects and protect vulnerable populations  and to fully understand the potential health effects of chronic or intermittent exposure to indoor air with higher CO2 concentrations.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.10271739130434784,15700,0.013

Our objective was to examine the association of drinking patterns with changes in physical and mental well-being across populations.  METHODS: We conducted a multilevel analysis with multivariate responses in the population-representative FAMILY Cohort in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region  China  to examine the association between alcohol drinking patterns across 2 waves (2009–2013) (i.e.  quitters  initiators  persistent drinkers  persistent former drinkers and lifetime abstainers) and changes in physical and mental well-being (Physical and Mental Component Summary of the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey [SF-12]). Analyses were stratified by sex. We validated findings using a nationally representative cohort in the United States  the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC  2001–2005).  RESULTS: In the FAMILY Cohort (n = 10 386; median follow-up 2.3 yr)  the change in mental well-being was more favourable in female quitters than in lifetime abstainers (β = 1.44  95% confidence interval [CI] 0.43 to 2.45; mean score change of +2.0 for quitters and +0.02 for lifetime abstainers). This association was validated in the NESARC (n = 31 079; median follow-up 3.1 yr) (β = 0.83  95% CI 0.08 to 1.58; mean score change of −1.1 for quitters and −1.6 for lifetime abstainers).  INTERPRETATION: The change in mental well-being was more favourable in female quitters  approaching the level of mental well-being of lifetime abstainers within 4 years of quitting in both Chinese and American populations.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.006986215538847122,15708,

Basically people that report not drinking have higher rates of reported mental well being. It could be that some or most people lie and/or suffer from presentation bias  and that alone could yield these results.   You can’t really make even the conclusion of correlation based upon survey data alone. It needs to be cross referenced with medical records  purchase records  medication use  mental health diagnoses  and other forms of validation to be meaningful.   It’s entirely likely that people that have suffering in life are more likely to turn to substance use and vice versa  and the causation could be cyclic and bidirectional.

One could not make the assumption that abstaining leads to mental wellbeing. Also  in general  it might be safe to assume that quitters quit because they were more content in general  instead of assuming that quitting leads to contentment or wellbeing.   Sure  alcohol use might throw a person into a negative loop  but I would still lean on the assumption that people who suffer use alcohol to self-medicate. Once the need to self-medicate is gone  alcohol use decreases. People would not self-medicate with alcohol if it didn't help them at least partially. Making alcohol the devil isn't helping anyone. It just makes people who self-medicate with it feel even worse  furthering their suffering and need for self-mefication.

National and State Estimates of Lost Earnings From Cancer Deaths in the United States.   JAMA Oncology  2019;   Link: https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/article-abstract/2737074  DOI: 10.1001/jamaoncol.2019.1460  Key Points  Question  What is the estimated monetary value of lost earnings due to cancer deaths in the United States nationally and by state?  Findings  In this population-based study  estimated lost earnings due to cancer deaths in persons aged 16 to 84 years in the United States in 2015 were $94.4 billion; age-standardized lost earning rates were the largest in the South  followed by the Midwest. Achieving Utah’s age-specific lost earning rates in all states could reduce lost earnings related to cancer deaths in the United States in 2015 by 29.3% ($27.7 billion)  ranging from 13.6% in Colorado to 47.3% in Kentucky and 47.0% in Mississippi.  Meaning  Preventing premature deaths from cancer through delivery of effective cancer prevention  screening  and treatment may have economic benefit for the United States nationally and in all states.  Abstract  Importance  Information on the economic burden of cancer mortality can serve as a tool in setting policies and prioritizing resources for cancer prevention and control. However  contemporary data are lacking for the United States nationally and by state.  Objective  To estimate lost earnings due to death from cancer overall and for the major cancers in the United States nationally and by state.  Design  Setting  and Participants  Person-years of life lost (PYLL) were calculated using numbers of cancer deaths and life expectancy data in individuals aged 16 to 84 years who died from cancer in the United States in 2015. The annual median earnings in the United States were used to assign a monetary value for each PYLL by age and sex. Cancer mortality and life expectancy data were obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics and annual median earnings from the US Census Bureau’s 2016 Current Population Survey’s March Annual Social and Economic Supplement. Data analysis was performed from October 22  2018  to February 25  2019.  Main Outcomes and Measures  Lost earnings due to cancer death  represented as estimated future wages in the absence of premature death.  Results  A total of 8 739 939 person-years of life were lost to cancer death in persons aged 16 to 84 years in the United States in 2015  translating to lost earnings of $94.4 billion (95% CI  $91.7 billion-$97.3 billion). For individual cancer sites  lost earnings were highest for lung cancer ($21.3 billion)  followed by colorectal ($9.4 billion)  female breast ($6.2 billion)  and pancreatic ($6.1 billion) cancer. Age-standardized lost earning rates per 100 000 were lowest in the West and highest in the South  ranging from $19.6 million (95% CI  $19.1 million-$20.2 million) in Utah to $35.3 million ($34.4 million-$36.3 million) in Kentucky. Approximately 2.4 million PYLL and $27.7 billion (95% CI  $26.9 billion-$28.5 billion) in lost earnings (29.3% of total that occurred in 2015) would have been avoided in 2015 if all states had the same age-specific PYLL or lost earning rates as Utah.  Conclusions and Relevance  Our findings indicate large state variation in the economic burden of cancer and suggest the potential for substantial financial benefit through delivery of effective cancer prevention  screening  and treatment to minimize premature cancer mortality in all states.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.059768009768009764,15756,0.015

Knowing that 94b will be lost from productive years of people who die prematurely from cancer may pass a threshold where companies/governments decide to invest more heavily in preventative care/screening/health insurance for employees etc. If you can avoid the deaths of some of the people they are able to continue to provide benefit to the economy.   The incentive for governmental regulation is there to continue to promote a healthy economy and the well being of its people. On the corporate side of things there will end up being a cost/benefit analysis to determine if the cost of providing insurance (so people are more likely to see a Dr.  get diagnosed early etc) will end up being cheaper than the cost of retraining/loss of talent/hiring fees etc.  Edit: changed 90m to 94b.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.2375,15766,

They’re not losing it  someone else will get hired and earn that money and pay taxes.  The company is not losing it either. So the stat is useless. Now if it had calculated the cost of retraining  then the stat would be useful.  Edit: put yourself into the shoes of a manager. If an employee tells me he’s dying of cancer  my first thought is sadness and how his death will impact his family. My second thought is that I need to hire someone to replace them. That might take 2 months to hire and another 3-4 months to get them caught up. So my loss is about 6 months of time and salary. Nowhere in my mind will I consider how much money that person could have earned if he lived longer. How does that help me make decisions? What if an employee lives to a 100 but quits his job after a year?  The point is the 94b might be an interesting stat  but it’s absolutely useless from a decision making standpoint.

Labour is finite. Low population areas tend to have lower GDP and don’t have the economic strength of higher pop areas. When a person dies prematurely they lose the ability to contribute to the economy through taxes  purchases etc so that money is just taken out. When looking at the 94b that number is still a hit  even if it’s divided up so that no one has the entire burden of the loss. It may even be imperceptible  but the potential no longer exists.  A company is not taking a 94b loss from one employee dying. They may however take a loss of $50000 annually just from sickness/death for their whole staff. This is all theoretical and I don’t have access to the actual numbers  but if a company found out they could drop that $50000 annual loss to $30000 through a $12000 insurance plan then the likelihood of them doing that is high. Money is going to win in the decision making of a corporation the majority of the time.

Figure out your true needs and then research insurance. Find an in network insurance that works with your dentist and doesn’t blow up your bank. My dentist told me their in-network insurances they accept and I did my research on them for awhile to figure which works for me. I used to pay $28 for the gym and cut it out to make room for this because dental is higher priority. I pay $29  a month for my insurance which takes care of all preventative work  bring costs down on all other major work but doesn’t cover too much orthodontic work I believe( off the top of my head) I have a $50 deductible and a $1500 maximum. Now because it’s an in-network insurance; say I use that whole $1500 maximum and need work done I will get a discount on the work even tho it’s not fully covered it’s still cheaper. I still need to learn more about dental insurance but here’s what I know about it and hope it helps anyone! Also if you’ve been hesitant on going because you will be judged  just go!! I felt much better and I wasn’t judged as much as I thought I would. At the end of the day my teeth are whiter  healthier  and bother me much less!

To explain Say your insurance pays 80% for a procedure that is 100 dollars. So you send the claim for $100 and insurance pays $80 (not dealing with deductibles in this equation). Then if the Dr writes off that $20 and does not collect it is fraud  since his fee is now technically $80. I have to explain dental insurance all day everyday.

We aimed to investigate the associations between economic decline  incarceration rates  and age-standardised mortality from drug use disorders at the county level in the USA.  Methods  In this observational analysis  we examined age-standardised mortality data from the US National Vital Statistics System and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation  household income data from the US Census Bureau  and county-level jail and prison incarceration data from the Vera Institute of Justice for 2640 US counties between 1983 and 2014. We also extracted data on county-level control variables from the US Census Bureau  the National Center for Health Statistics  and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We used a two-way fixed-effects panel regression to examine the association between reduced household income  incarceration  and mortality from drug use disorders within counties over time. To assess between-county variation  we used coarsened exact matching and a simulation-based modelling approach.  Findings  After adjusting for key confounders  each 1 SD decrease in median household income was associated with an increase of 12·8% (95% CI 11·0–14·6; p<0·0001) in drug-related deaths within counties. Each 1 SD increase in jail and prison incarceration rates was associated with an increase of 1·5% (95% CI 1·0–2·0; p<0·0001) and 2·6% (2·1–3·1; p<0·0001) in drug-related mortality  respectively. The association between drug-related mortality and income and incarceration persisted after controlling for local opioid prescription rates. Our model accounts for a large proportion of within-county variation in mortality from drug use disorders (R2=0·975). Between counties  high rates of incarceration were associated with a more than 50% increase in drug-related deaths.  Interpretation  Reduced household income and high incarceration rates are associated with poor health. The rapid expansion of the prison and jail population in the USA over the past four decades might have contributed to the increasing number of deaths from drug use disorders.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.10601934523809524,15851,0.083

Abstract's language on sugar-sweetened beverages   > Experimental studies provide insight into potential biological mechanisms and illustrate that intake of SSBs increases T2D and cardiovascular risk factors.

What it says about artificial sweeteners   > Consumption of artificially sweetened beverages is unlikely to promote weight gain or metabolic dysfunction; however  some evidence suggests that the intense sweetness of artificial sweeteners (160–13 000 ×sweeter than sucrose) [59] may condition toward a greater preference for sweets and thus may enhance appetite [60]. Diet soda may also enhance appetite by cephalic phase stimulation  although this area remains controversial.  > A few studies have reported positive associations between diet soda consumption and weight gain and risk of metabolic syndrome and T2D [21  22  57]. However  these observations may be due to reverse causation or residual confounding  since for example  diet soda consumption is higher among individuals with T2D compared to those without T2D.  > Diet soda was also associated with weight loss in our study evaluating the effects of changes in diet and lifestyle factors on weight change,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.0009740259740259882,15898,

Effects of cannabinoid administration for pain: A meta-analysis and meta-regression.   Experimental and Clinical Psychopharmacology. 2019  Link: https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-28227-001?doi=1  DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/pha0000281  Abstract  Chronic pain states have resulted in an overreliance on opioid pain relievers  which can carry significant risks when used long term. As such  alternative pain treatments are increasingly desired. Although emerging research suggests that cannabinoids have therapeutic potential regarding pain  results from studies across pain populations have been inconsistent. To provide meta-analytic clarification regarding cannabis’s impact on subjective pain  we identified studies that assessed drug-induced pain modulations under cannabinoid and corresponding placebo conditions. A literature search yielded 25 peer-reviewed records that underwent data extraction. Baseline and end-point data were used to compute standardized effect size estimates (Cohen’s d) across cannabinoid administrations (k = 39) and placebo administrations (k = 26). Standardized effects were inverse-variance weighted and pooled across studies for meta-analytic comparison. Results revealed that cannabinoid administration produced a medium-to-large effect across included studies  Cohen’s d = −0.58  95% confidence interval (CI) [−0.74  −0.43]  while placebo administration produced a small-to-medium effect  Cohen’s d = −0.39  95% CI [−0.52  −0.26]. Meta-regression revealed that cannabinoids  β = −0.43  95% CI [−0.62  −0.24]  p < .05  synthetic cannabinoids  β = −0.39  95% CI [−0.65  −0.14]  p < .05  and sample size  β = 0.01  95% CI [0.00  0.01]  p < .05  were associated with marked pain reduction. These outcomes suggest that cannabinoid-based pharmacotherapies may serve as effective replacement/adjunctive options regarding pain  however  additional research is warranted. Additionally  given demonstrated neurocognitive side effects associated with some constituent cannabinoids (i.e.  THC)  subsequent work may consider developing novel therapeutic agents that capitalize on cannabis’s analgesic properties without producing adverse effects.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.1694602272727273,15905,-0.067

How to use social media for cervical cancer prevention: A multi-method study of the effects of sender type and content type on increased message sharing.   Preventive Medicine  2019; 105751   Link: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091743519302270  DOI: 10.1016/j.ypmed.2019.105751  Highlights  • A multi-method study to promote cervical cancer prevention messages on social media  • The sender type and content type of 462 observed tweet messages were analyzed.  • 87 online experimental groups involving 782 women and 900 messages were studied.  • Organizational senders and factual information boost social media shares.  • Establishing sender credibility and delivering factual information are the keys.  Abstract  Social media has become a valuable tool for disseminating cancer prevention information. However  the design of messages for achieving wide dissemination remains poorly understood. We conducted a multi-method study to identify the effects of sender type (individuals or organizations) and content type (personal experiences or factual information) on promoting the spread of cervical cancer prevention messages over social media. First  we used observational Twitter data to examine correlations between sender type and content type with retweet activity. Then  to confirm the causal impact of message properties  we constructed 900 experimental tweets according to a 2 (sender type) by 2 (content type) factorial design and tested their probabilities of being shared in an online platform. A total of 782 female participants were randomly assigned to 87 independent 9-person online groups and each received a unique message feed of 100 tweets drawn from the 4 experimental cells over 5 days. We conducted both tweet-level and group-level analyses to examine the causal effects of tweet properties on influencing sharing behaviors. Personal experience tweets and organizational senders were associated with more retweets. However  the experimental study revealed that informational tweets were shared significantly more (19%  95% CI: 11 to 27) than personal experience tweets; and organizational senders were shared significantly more (10%  95% CI: 3 to 18) than individual senders. While rare personal experience messages can achieve large success  they are generally unsuccessful; however  there is a reproducible causal effect of messages that use organizational senders and factual information for achieving greater peer-to-peer dissemination.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.15434632034632031,15907,0.093

Journal Reference:  Natasha van Zyl  Bridget Hill  Catherine Cooper  Jodie Hahn  Mary P Galea.   Expanding traditional tendon-based techniques with nerve transfers for the restoration of upper limb function in tetraplegia: a prospective case series.   The Lancet  2019;   Link: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(19)31143-2/fulltext  DOI: 10.1016/S0140-6736(19)31143-2  Summary  Background  Loss of upper extremity function after cervical spinal cord injury greatly affects independence  including social  vocational  and community engagement. Nerve transfer surgery offers an exciting new option for the reanimation of upper limb function in tetraplegia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of nerve transfer surgery used for the reanimation of upper limb function in tetraplegia. Methods  In this prospective case series  we consecutively recruited people of any age with early (<18 months post-injury) cervical spinal cord injury of motor level C5 and below  who had been referred to a single centre for upper extremity reanimation and were deemed suitable for nerve transfer. All participants underwent single or multiple nerve transfers in one or both upper limbs  sometimes combined with tendon transfers  for restoration of elbow extension  grasp  pinch  and hand opening. Participants were assessed at 12 months and 24 months post-surgery. Primary outcome measures were the action research arm test (ARAT)  grasp release test (GRT)  and spinal cord independence measure (SCIM).  Findings  Between April 14  2014  and Nov 22  2018  we recruited 16 participants (27 limbs) with traumatic spinal cord injury  among whom 59 nerve transfers were done. In ten participants (12 limbs)  nerve transfers were combined with tendon transfers. 24-month follow-up data were unavailable for three patients (five limbs). At 24 months  significant improvements from baseline in median ARAT total score (34·0 [IQR 24·0–38·3] at 24 months vs 16·5 [12·0–22·0] at baseline  p<0·0001) and GRT total score (125·2 [65·1–154·4] vs 35·0 [21·0–52·3]  p<0·0001) were observed. Mean total SCIM score and mobility in the room and toilet SCIM score improved by more than the minimal detectable change and the minimal clinically important difference  and the mean self-care SCIM score improved by more than the minimal detectable change between baseline and 24 months. Median Medical Research Council strength grades were 3 (IQR 2–3) for triceps and 4 (IQR 4–4) for digital extensor muscles after 24 months. Mean grasp strength at 24 months was 3·2 kg (SD 1·5) in participants who underwent distal nerve transfers (n=5)  2·8 kg (3·2) in those who had proximal nerve transfers (n=9)  and 3·9 kg (2·4) in those who had tendon transfers (n=8). There were six adverse events related to the surgery  none of which had any ongoing functional consequences.  Interpretation  Early nerve transfer surgery is a safe and effective addition to surgical techniques for upper limb reanimation in tetraplegia. Nerve transfers can lead to significant functional improvement and can be successfully combined with tendon transfers to maximise functional benefits.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.12912012987012988,15951,0.128

Experimental Design:   Fifteen patients enrolled on this 'window of opportunity' phase 1 study  exposing primary bladder cancers to CAVATAK prior to surgery. The first nine patients received intravesical administration of monotherapy CAVATAK; in the second stage  six patients received CAVATAK with a sub-therapeutic dose of mitomycinC  known to enhance expression of ICAM-1 on bladder cancer cells. The primary endpoint was to determine patient safety and maximum tolerated dose. Secondary endpoints were evidence of viral replication  induction of inflammatory cytokines  anti-tumour activity and viral-induced changes in resected tissue.   Results:   Clinical activity of CAVATAK was demonstrated by induction of tumour inflammation and haemorrhage following either single or multiple administrations of CAVATAK in multiple patients  and a complete resolution of tumour in one patient. Whether used alone or in combination with mitomycinC  CAVATAK caused marked inflammatory changes within NMIBC tissue biopsies by up-regulating interferon-inducible genes including both immune checkpoint-inhibitory genes (PD-L1 and LAG3) and Th1-associated chemokines as well as induction of the innate activator RIG-I  compared to bladder cancer tissue from untreated patients. No significant toxicities were reported in any patient  from either virus or combination therapy.   Conclusions:   The acceptable safety profile of CAVATAK  proof of viral targeting  replication and tumour cell death together with the virus-mediated increases in ""immunological heat"" within the tumour microenvironment all indicate that CAVATAK may be potentially considered as a novel therapeutic for NMIBC.",,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",-0.008997252747252741,15955,-0.031

Findings  In this observational study of school-level data from 9 323 315 kindergartners who started attending school between 2000 and 2017  the rate of kindergartners without up-to-date vaccination status decreased from 9.84% during 2013 (before the interventions) to 4.87% during 2017 (after the interventions).  Meaning  In California  statewide legislative and educational interventions were associated with a decrease in the yearly rates of kindergartners without up-to-date vaccination status.  Abstract  Importance  California implemented 3 interventions to increase uptake of vaccines. In 2014  Assembly bill 2109 tightened requirements for obtaining a personal belief exemption. A 2015 campaign provided educational materials to school staff on the proper application of conditional admission for kindergartners who were not up to date on required vaccinations. In 2016  Senate bill 277 eliminated personal belief exemptions. Prior research has not evaluated these 3 interventions together with regard to the vaccination status of students.  Objective  To assess the changes in the yearly rates of kindergartners who were not up to date on required vaccinations who were entering school during the period of the interventions  by focusing on geographic clustering and the potential contacts of these kindergartners.  Design  Setting  and Participants  Observational study that used cross-sectional school-entry data from 2000-2017 to calculate the rates of kindergartners attending California schools who were not up to date on required vaccinations.  Exposures  Assembly bill 2109  a conditional admission education program  and Senate bill 277.  Main Outcomes and Measures  The primary outcome was the yearly rate of kindergartners without up-to-date vaccination status. The secondary outcomes were (1) the modified aggregation index  which was used to assess the potential within-school contacts among kindergartners without up-to-date vaccination status  (2) the number of geographic clusters of schools with rates for kindergartners without up-to-date vaccination status that were higher than the rates for schools located outside the cluster  and (3) the number of schools located inside the geographic clusters.  Results  In California between 2000 and 2017  9 323 315 children started attending kindergarten and 721 593 were not up to date on required vaccinations. Prior to the interventions  the statewide rate of kindergartners without up-to-date status for required vaccinations increased from 7.80% during 2000 to 9.84% during 2013 and then decreased after the interventions to 4.87% during 2017. The percentage chance for within-school contact among kindergartners without up-to-date vaccination status decreased from 26.02% during 2014 to 4.56% (95% CI  4.21%-4.99%) during 2017. During 2012-2013  there were 124 clusters that contained 3026 schools with high rates of kindergartners without up-to-date vaccination status. During 2014-2015  there were 93 clusters that contained 2290 schools with high rates of kindergartners without up-to-date vaccination status. During 2016-2017  there were 110 clusters that contained 1613 (95% CI  1565-1691) schools.  Conclusions and Relevance  In California  statewide legislative and educational interventions were associated with a decrease in the yearly rates of kindergartners without up-to-date vaccination status. These interventions also were associated with reductions in the number of schools inside the clusters with high rates of kindergartners without up-to-date vaccination status and the potential for contact among these kindergartners.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.08099099099099101,15967,

Tax collectors are repeatedly used as examples for the lowest forms of humans. The Good Samaritan story makes a case for helping a needy person voluntarily out of love and compassion  not force. There's no suggestion that the Samaritan ""owed"" anything to the man in need or that it was the duty of a distant politician to help out with other people's money.

Journal Reference:  Sreyan Chowdhury  Samuel Castro  Courtney Coker  Taylor E. Hinchliffe  Nicholas Arpaia  Tal Danino.   Programmable bacteria induce durable tumor regression and systemic antitumor immunity.   Nature Medicine  2019;   Link: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-019-0498-z  DOI: 10.1038/s41591-019-0498-z  Abstract  Synthetic biology is driving a new era of medicine through the genetic programming of living cells1 2. This transformative approach allows for the creation of engineered systems that intelligently sense and respond to diverse environments  ultimately adding specificity and efficacy that extends beyond the capabilities of molecular-based therapeutics3 4 5 6. One particular area of focus has been the engineering of bacteria as therapeutic delivery systems to selectively release therapeutic payloads in vivo7 8 9 10 11. Here we engineered a non-pathogenic Escherichia coli strain to specifically lyse within the tumor microenvironment and release an encoded nanobody antagonist of CD47 (CD47nb)12  an anti-phagocytic receptor that is commonly overexpressed in several human cancer types13 14. We show that delivery of CD47nb by tumor-colonizing bacteria increases activation of tumor-infiltrating T cells  stimulates rapid tumor regression  prevents metastasis and leads to long-term survival in a syngeneic tumor model in mice. Moreover  we report that local injection of CD47nb-expressing bacteria stimulates systemic tumor-antigen-specific immune responses that reduce the growth of untreated tumors  providing proof-of-concept for an abscopal effect induced by an engineered bacterial immunotherapy. Thus  engineered bacteria may be used for safe and local delivery of immunotherapeutic payloads leading to systemic antitumor immunity.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.1338274044795784,16005,0.0

It is a weak opening and should have been based on stronger sources.  &#x200B;  They even stuff up the meta analysis which did not find a link but suggests a link. For a meta study that is the weakest possible conclusion to make and only continues the speculation where there is no evidence. The evidence should have been far more clear cut than that if it were there. The same study even includes a Seralini citation.   &#x200B;  When you consider farmers who are arguably the most effected population are up in arms over these bans you need to ask why? Why would farmers risk their lives and cancer by supporting glyphosate if they actually believe their is a risk from use? Farmers are not stupid and know how to run their farms well on the limited money that they have.  A ban on non-commercial use might make sense but not an agricultural ban.

Second of all  they’re objectively speaking not “little details”. Third of all  no  of course not. You made the argument that people just need to read the labelling  I explained why that wouldn’t work in itself. But there’s obviously a lot more to this issue than just understanding the science.  Junk food has been shown to stimulate the reward system in the brain in the same way as many addictive drugs. It’s easy to tell someone to drop the habit of constantly eating junk food  it’s much harder to actually do it. It’s simple biology.  In high-income countries  people of lower socioeconomic status are more likely to be obese - the issue of obesity is directly linked to economic factors. Long  exhausting work hours with a low salary means less time  energy and money to spend making meals from scratch  meal prepping and exercising.   Poverty also affects your mental health (studies show that people living of lower SES are far more likely to develop mental illnesses than people of higher SES) which can in turn affect your physical health - a mentally ill person is more likely to seek out junk food and substance abuse  because they feel like they need that short-lived spike of satisfaction to make up for the constant stress and anxiety they face everyday.

I'm pretty sure you could ask gyms that don't have apps if there's a way to check the number of times you've signed in since most gyms have electronic systems.   >Also  can you please explain to me why poorer people are so reliant on junk food? The idea that they're disproportionately affected is never explained. What about poverty necessitates a diet with more potato chips  soda and fast food french fries than other groups?    I'm not a behavioral psychologist but I can give you my two cents. Poor people are often stressed. I know everyone has stress  but it's a different level of anxiety when you don't know how you're going to pay your bills. Food serves as an escape for people  and the sugar/fat/chemicals in bad food causes dopamine to be released giving them a high. It's one of the few pleasures accessible to poor people.   Geography/history play a role. The fattest states in the US are in the south and/or rural areas. Those states have foods embedded in their culture that are awful for them. It's hard to tell someone from Mississippi not to eat Fried Catfish and Hush Puppies. That's been their culture for hundreds of years.

Using models of physiological and dysregulated IFNα/β receptor (IFNAR1) surface expression  we show here that IFNAR1-dependent signals set the steady-state IFN signature in both hematopoietic and stromal cells. Increased IFNAR1 levels promote a lung environment refractory to early influenza virus replication by elevating the baseline interferon signature. Commensal microbiota drive the IFN signature specifically in lung stroma  as shown by antibiotic treatment and fecal transplantation. Bone marrow chimera experiments identify lung stromal cells as crucially important for early antiviral immunity and stroma-immune cell interaction for late antiviral resistance. We propose that the microbiota-driven interferon signature in lung epithelia impedes early virus replication and that IFNAR1 surface levels fine-tune this signature. Our findings highlight the interplay between bacterial and viral exposure  with important implications for antibiotic use.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.09928229665071772,16140,

To address this issue  we exposed mice to a single episode of voluntary exercise  and permanently marked activated mature hippocampal dentate granule cells using conditional Fos-TRAP mice. Exercise-activated neurons (Fos-TRAPed) showed an input-selective increase in dendritic spines and excitatory postsynaptic currents at 3 days post-exercise  indicative of exercise-induced structural plasticity. Laser-capture microdissection and RNASeq of activated neurons revealed that the most highly induced transcript was Mtss1L  a little-studied I-BAR domain-containing gene  which we hypothesized could be involved in membrane curvature and dendritic spine formation. shRNA-mediated Mtss1L knockdown in vivo prevented the exercise-induced increases in spines and excitatory postsynaptic currents. Our results link short-term effects of exercise to activity-dependent expression of Mtss1L  which we propose as a novel effector of activity-dependent rearrangement of synapses.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.08131696428571428,16143,0.251

HPV infection is linked to multiple types of cancers resulting in high economic and health burden. We aimed to estimate the excess number of cancer cases and associated medical costs due to current human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination coverage for a 20 year old birth cohort in California.  Methods   We estimated the lifetime number of cancer cases caused by vaccine-preventable strains of HPV for a cohort of 20 year olds in California. We then estimated the excess number of cancer cases in that cohort which would occur due to 2017 HPV vaccination coverage compared to an optimal coverage of 99.5%. By multiplying those excess cases by the average cost of treatment  we determined the excess cost due to current HPV vaccination coverage.  Results   With current vaccination coverage in California  the 20 year old cohort is at risk for an excess 1352 cancer cases that could be prevented with a projected optimal vaccination coverage of 99.5%. The excess cost of treatment for those cancer cases would be $52.2 million. Male oropharyngeal cancer accounts for the greatest projected cost burden $21.3 million followed by cervical cancer $16.1 million.  Conclusion   Increased HPV vaccination coverage in California is needed to reduce economic and health burdens associated with cancers caused by HPV infection.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.10821212121212123,16151,-0.001

Applied Ergonomics  2019; 80: 28   Link: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687019300821  DOI: 10.1016/j.apergo.2019.05.003  Highlights  • Carrying a backpack and pulling a trolley are two common options for schoolchildren.  • The gait kinematic waveforms were analysed using statistic parametric mapping.  • Pulling a trolley produced minimal kinematic impact regardless of load increase.  • The recommended load for children using a school trolley is up to 20% BW.   Abstract  The use of a school trolley is reaching and even surpassing the use of backpacks in many countries  although a recommended load has not been studied. To accomplish this  3D gait kinematics of the lower limbs and thorax were analysed in 49 students walking unloaded  pulling a school trolley or carrying a backpack  all with either 10%  15%  or 20% BW. The variables obtained were the degrees of flexion/extension  adduction/abduction and internal/external rotation of the thorax  pelvis  hip  knee and ankle. Statistical parametric mapping was used to evaluate differences between conditions and loads throughout the gait cycle. In the backpack conditions  the magnitudes of the differences decreased from proximal to distal joints compared to the unloaded condition. The use of a school trolley only required minor kinematic adaptations. Therefore  from kinematic analysis  it is recommended to avoid loads above 10% BW for children using a backpack and below 20% BW for children using a trolley.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.065,16156,

This observational study focused on three statewide initiatives: a 2014 bill requiring parents to prove they had discussed the risks of not vaccinating their children with a health care provider before getting a personal belief exemption; a 2015 educational campaign by state and local health departments to educate school staff on conditional admission criteria that allow students more time to catch up on vaccinations; and a 2016 bill banning all personal belief exemptions for vaccinations. Researchers used school entry data to calculate rates of kindergartners attending California schools without up-to-date vaccines. The authors report the rate of kindergartners without up-to-date vaccinations decreased from 9.84% during 2013 (before the three statewide interventions) to 4.87% in 2017 (after the interventions).

Findings  In this observational study of school-level data from 9 323 315 kindergartners who started attending school between 2000 and 2017  the rate of kindergartners without up-to-date vaccination status decreased from 9.84% during 2013 (before the interventions) to 4.87% during 2017 (after the interventions).  Meaning  In California  statewide legislative and educational interventions were associated with a decrease in the yearly rates of kindergartners without up-to-date vaccination status.  Abstract  Importance  California implemented 3 interventions to increase uptake of vaccines. In 2014  Assembly bill 2109 tightened requirements for obtaining a personal belief exemption. A 2015 campaign provided educational materials to school staff on the proper application of conditional admission for kindergartners who were not up to date on required vaccinations. In 2016  Senate bill 277 eliminated personal belief exemptions. Prior research has not evaluated these 3 interventions together with regard to the vaccination status of students.  Objective  To assess the changes in the yearly rates of kindergartners who were not up to date on required vaccinations who were entering school during the period of the interventions  by focusing on geographic clustering and the potential contacts of these kindergartners.  Design  Setting  and Participants  Observational study that used cross-sectional school-entry data from 2000-2017 to calculate the rates of kindergartners attending California schools who were not up to date on required vaccinations.  Exposures  Assembly bill 2109  a conditional admission education program  and Senate bill 277.  Main Outcomes and Measures  The primary outcome was the yearly rate of kindergartners without up-to-date vaccination status. The secondary outcomes were (1) the modified aggregation index  which was used to assess the potential within-school contacts among kindergartners without up-to-date vaccination status  (2) the number of geographic clusters of schools with rates for kindergartners without up-to-date vaccination status that were higher than the rates for schools located outside the cluster  and (3) the number of schools located inside the geographic clusters.  Results  In California between 2000 and 2017  9 323 315 children started attending kindergarten and 721 593 were not up to date on required vaccinations. Prior to the interventions  the statewide rate of kindergartners without up-to-date status for required vaccinations increased from 7.80% during 2000 to 9.84% during 2013 and then decreased after the interventions to 4.87% during 2017. The percentage chance for within-school contact among kindergartners without up-to-date vaccination status decreased from 26.02% during 2014 to 4.56% (95% CI  4.21%-4.99%) during 2017. During 2012-2013  there were 124 clusters that contained 3026 schools with high rates of kindergartners without up-to-date vaccination status. During 2014-2015  there were 93 clusters that contained 2290 schools with high rates of kindergartners without up-to-date vaccination status. During 2016-2017  there were 110 clusters that contained 1613 (95% CI  1565-1691) schools.  Conclusions and Relevance  In California  statewide legislative and educational interventions were associated with a decrease in the yearly rates of kindergartners without up-to-date vaccination status. These interventions also were associated with reductions in the number of schools inside the clusters with high rates of kindergartners without up-to-date vaccination status and the potential for contact among these kindergartners.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.0557843137254902,16210,0.105

Sequential LASER ART and CRISPR Treatments Eliminate HIV-1 in a Subset of Infected Humanized Mice.   Nature Communications  2019; 10 (1)   Link: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10366-y  DOI: 10.1038/s41467-019-10366-y  Abstract  Elimination of HIV-1 requires clearance and removal of integrated proviral DNA from infected cells and tissues. Here  sequential long-acting slow-effective release antiviral therapy (LASER ART) and CRISPR-Cas9 demonstrate viral clearance in latent infectious reservoirs in HIV-1 infected humanized mice. HIV-1 subgenomic DNA fragments  spanning the long terminal repeats and the Gag gene  are excised in vivo  resulting in elimination of integrated proviral DNA; virus is not detected in blood  lymphoid tissue  bone marrow and brain by nested and digital-droplet PCR as well as RNAscope tests. No CRISPR-Cas9 mediated off-target effects are detected. Adoptive transfer of human immunocytes from dual treated  virus-free animals to uninfected humanized mice fails to produce infectious progeny virus. In contrast  HIV-1 is readily detected following sole LASER ART or CRISPR-Cas9 treatment. These data provide proof-of-concept that permanent viral elimination is possible.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.06549707602339183,16211,0.026
