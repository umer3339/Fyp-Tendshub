Contracted rates and insurance plans. You can say your service costs $1000 but each payer will have a different contracted rate and each plan will have a different reimbursement. So aetna might have the total cost be $400 and BCBS would have it be $600. And if you have Aetna medicaid  you might pay $100 but BCBS PPO would pay $200.   So just because you might have a gross price  you may not be saving money. And the average consumer or patient does not understand this.  So the solution IMO is either a single payer to control prices or institute price ceilings for services.

You must report your change of income because then you will qualify for Medicaid. If you qualify for Medicaid then they will take away your subsidy for your Obamacare plan and you will have to pay it back as far back as Medicaid will backdate you. So you need to do this asap before you get into a giant hole and you may as well take the Medicaid. When you get a change of income from your new job you have to report that again so you might get kicked off the Medicaid then. I don't want Medicaid either and we have to pay back our subsidies for June and July (months we already paid premiums for and won't be getting that back)  and since we need to get insurance back to May we'll have to pay for other insurance on top of that back to May without a subsidy  then in September when my job starts again we'll get kicked off it anyway.

78,_____Harambe_____,[Question - Insurance] 2019 Healthcare ACA questions regarding overestimated income  not qualifying  repayment,"Last year (2018) I had estimated making right around the poverty line being roughly 12 500 for the year.  I had insurance through the marketplace and 99% of my premiums were covered. I went through 3 surgeries and greatly benefited from my wonderful coverage.  All was well and everything worked out perfectly at the end of the year and tax time.  I am in North Carolina as reference  and medicaid was not expanded.     I had renewed my insurance for 2019 and estimated to make the same amount  so everything ""should"" have worked out the same.  But  at the end of 2018 I had lost my job  and have struggled to find anything since.  It is now July and I have made $0 for the year (living off of family support and savings).    My huge concern is what will happen if I make less than the poverty line  or for example do not make anything at all.  Will I have to pay back the $600 a month in subsidies?  Should I cancel my insurance now to potentially save myself some money when that happens?     I understand there is a good chunk of the year left and that I could potentially find a job and make the money that I need to.  I just want to be prepared in case that does not happen.    I have contacted the healthcare marketplace and they told me there is no information they can provide on their end  and that if any repayment was issued  it would be through the IRS.

That's a huge number.  My guess is the biggest issue  and the one where private insurance and big pharma are really fighting  are the newer meds that target very specific conditions like specialized oral chemotherapy   or newer immune modulators.  The vast majority of people do just fine on relatively inexpensive meds like blood pressure or anti depressants or the occasional antibiotic  but a few people have ENORMOUS pharmacy bills  especially inpatient.

141,PatrickGlowacki,[Question - Insurance] I’m turning 26 with ADD,Hello. I really need some advice. I’m pretty sure I’m going to be denied coverage.  Some info.

First check and see if yuh qualify for Medicaid. If not  check your state’s health exchange site (you can start with healthcare.gov).   For an exchange plan  no you cannot be denied for any ore-existing condition (thanks to the ACA)  and your rates cannot be higher becomes of that.   If you miss the deadline or cant afford one of those plans (you may qualify for subsidies depending on your income level)  then you’re in the realm of old school non-ACA plans which can deny you or rate you up  though in the scope of things ADD is not like trying to get a plan when you have a chronic or major disease. You’re not that expensive. Just be wary of ‘cheap’ plans that don’t cover major hospitalizations  that’s why you need insurance.   Your other option obviously is to get a job that does offer coverage. Always ask what the premium cost to you would be before you agree to work somewhere. Some employers offer good plans and others make you pay for a lot of it  which while cheaper than an exchange plan with no subsidies is still going to be pricey.   Hope that helps.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.07402597402597402,16868,

In that case no  with the ADA (aka obamacare) it is now illegal to deny coverage due to preexisting conditions. Before that they could.

Is this a serious question?  > If I get a plan  is my rate going to be high because I’m diagnosed ADD compared to someone without a pre existing condition?  I don't know how people on reddit are supposed to tell you what your rates will be  but generally speaking the way insurance works is they try to calculate their risks/costs when calculating your rate.  The more complex/expensive conditions require higher rates.  Think heart conditions  chronic kidney disease  cancers  etc.  I think ADHD is normally treated with a prescription  not that expensive. > Is the ADD on my medical record permanently? ( I think I know the answer to this but it leads into my next question)  I believe a diagnosis stays on your medical record as long as it is clinically significant.  Requiring a medication would qualify  yes.  They can't get you your prescription without documenting the condition. > If it’s permanent  is there something I can sign to agree to not go to a doctor for a prescription for it to try and lower my rate?  No.  That wouldn't be a good idea for doctors or insurances.  > I’m really worried. Not sure what I’m going to do.  I'll be honest  I think you're way over-thinking this.  ADHD is not a big deal.  Like at  all.  Pretty much nobody cares.  It's not going to impact your ability to get insurance  I doubt it will impact your rates significantly  and you don't need any special arrangements with insurance.  Don't worry about it.  You're good.  Also  maybe look into your anxiety  it's normal  but medication can help for that  and I know people with ADHD often also have anxiety.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.16886128364389233,16870,

I don't even want to know what the crown will cost me. I've decided to travel back home (Puerto Rico) to get it done because when I called they told me that without insurance the total should be about $2385 ($100 x-ray  $85 extraction  $1200 implant  ~$1000 crown); the good news is it'll cost way less than this because my insurance said they'd pay ""up to 50%"" but it's good to know that even without using it I would have saved money.  I figure I'd have a mini vacation and get the surgery I need all for a bit less than doing it in the US.

As of right now I am on my Step Mother’s insurance plan. I work for my Dad and Uncle. We are a small company and don’t offer health plans so I’ll need to get one on my own.  So a couple of questions:  1. Can I be denied for having ADD?  2. If I get a plan  is my rate going to be high because I’m diagnosed ADD compared to someone without a pre existing condition?   3. Is the ADD on my medical record permanently? ( I think I know the answer to this but it leads into my next question)  4. If it’s permanent  is there something I can sign to agree to not go to a doctor for a prescription for it to try and lower my rate?  Any articles or first hand experiences would be greatly appreciated. I’m really worried. Not sure what I’m going to do.,https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/p__V_kEFJFPACSMtSgL_ODjQF3rJWnkZPM9jEbFQBjc.jpg,No video,2019-07-07 20:29:24,10.0,69.0,9.0,Mazziemom,That insurance isn't paying more than non insurance.

The clinic would have just been checking if the service in general is covered and insurance told them yes  it's not a guarantee though as it's all based on your insurance. There may be some reason the insurance decided not to cover  like if it was removed and replaced before expired I know they sometimes might reject and that's not something they would tell clinic when verifying it.

I don’t know the answer to the first question in hard numbers  but it is discussed a lot and it’s part of the motivation behind the bipartisan legislation on surprise billing that is making its way through Congress now. Other widely discussed problems are when the facility is in network but one or more physicians who deliver services are not (most notoriously  anesthesiologists).   As for how it is possible  in most states there are no limits on how much a provider can charge when it is not in network for an insurance plan. For both inpatient and outpatient services there is a facility fee for the expense of running the facility on top of the specific service fees that vary based on what was done and by whom. Patients often think they are going “in network” because they confirmed that either the physician performing the primary service or the facility itself is in network  but unknown to them the other component or some other physicians involved are not  so they get slammed with large unexpected bills.

A lot of providers do this  most commonly the RAPERS (radiologist  anesthesiologists  pathologists  ER groups  all within a hospital facility). These areas were common loss leaders in facility payment  so the hospitals stopped offering those services directly and subcontracted out those services to the types of entities mentioned in your question. These are often backed by VC capital firms out for the quick return. Another example being air ambulances. They refuse to contract with insurance companies and balance bill the member whatever they want.

Parking is a surprising money maker for hospitals too which is bananas. Most US hospitals are non-profit and are lucky to eek out a 2% margin. Things like parking fees help contribute to their slim profitability. But what the bean counters don’t get is that most people come to hospitals at some of the hardest times in their lives; It’s usually when we are sick  scared  in pain  or caring for someone who is unwell. Every little bit of friction we put in the path is undue harm. Making parking free and easier is literally the least we can do to remove some of that friction   It may  to many  sees like a small thing or the wrong probable to tackle.

You threw around theories about how people’s perceptions of physicians’ responsibilities is the issue  I added one actual fact  which is that a good portion of the country is living pay check to pay check. Have you ever lived like that? I have and I guarantee you’re not putting together nutritionally balanced meals  you’re eating what’s cheap and easy because you’re working 2 jobs and worrying about how you’re going to make rent that month.   Yes I’m making generalizations  but to say that socioeconomic factors have no bearing on the problems of preventable diseases and chalk it all up to lack of personal responsibility and misguided perceptions is at best oversimplifying and at worst  trying to shift blame to vulnerable populations.   I don’t disagree that people put too much faith in doctors  my personal experience is it’s the boomers and older generations who are the worst offenders there  running to the doctor for antibiotics when they have a cold and wondering why they have high cholesterol when they eat perfectly balanced meals like steak and loaded baked potatoes. 🤔,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.064,16950,

Health insurance  and affordable healthcare are vital to people being able to live healthy pain free lives. We can do better as a country about being more responsible for our own health  but a lack of insurance and access to basic care like a primary physician is a huge reason why many people don’t live healthy lives. Sometimes your parents don’t teach you good eating habits and it’s hard to find good information on what that really is without the help of someone other than the internet that recommends you ‘eat whatever you want just don’t eat for four days after!’  or ‘eat 18 pieces of artery clogging greasy bacon for breakfast everyday but just don’t eat carrots!’. Sometimes without a GP  without annual physicals and visits to a GP  people really just don’t know what healthy means or how to get there because of their environment and the people around them. And sometimes people just need someone there to keep them accountable for their health and keep them in check  isn’t that what annual physicals are for?

Don’t pay any bills from the hospital until you see the EOB. Keep in mind most plans have a deductible that has to be paid by you before insurance kicks in.

This is extremely common for any surgery or expensive procedure. Usually your doctor takes care of it but sometimes you have to request it. The reason is insurance doesn’t want to get stuck paying for something when a cheaper alternative existed that maybe you didn’t consider. For example  if you have a sore shoulder and go to an orthopedic surgeon  obviously they will say you need surgery. But maybe a brace and physical therapy would actually be sufficient  as an example.   Also make sure everyone involved is in network  according to your insurance company. That means the surgeon  assistant surgeon  anesthesiologist  facility (building where it will take place) and any other specialists involved (ie radiologist). Otherwise you may get stuck with a huge bill.   And keep in mind insurance won’t pay anything until you’ve paid your deductible. That means if your deductible is $5000 and you’ve paid nothing so far this year and the surgery costs $7000  they are only going to pay a portion of $2000. Make sure you have enough cash to cover the full deductible plus copay (usually 20%).,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.028333333333333332,16966,-0.3

That seems to be the argument you are loosely making here  but I may be wrong. What perplexes me about this is that while medical care is indeed a service and a good provided by a third party  it is something that third party chose to practice. Because they chose to practice it  they may also leave at any time if they are unsatisfied with the duties encompassed in the job description. Declaring healthcare a human right does not somehow infringe upon the individual rights of healthcare professionals because no one is demanding that they practice medicine  nor is anyone demanding that they practice it for free.  We could also apply this argument to K-12 public education in the United States. Education is also a service and a good provided by a third party (i.e. teachers). Yet at some point in history we as a society decided that K-12 education is something everyone should have the opportunity to pursue because it is valuable to our social and economic wellbeing. Like healthcare professionals  teachers and educational administrators have chosen their profession and are monetarily compensated for their labor. The logic you seem to be applying to healthcare would suggest that this is theft and slavery  and that we should abolish public education and solely leave it to the free market. Therefore  if you as a parent can't afford to send your child to a private school  too bad. That's the free market at work and sometimes it leaves people behind. I think most of us (liberals and conservatives alike) would find this egregiously unjust  and yet this is the exact argument being used to classify healthcare as a commodity. Either extend this argument to other facets of society that function similarly  or abandon it. I don't see how you can argue for both without severely undercutting the other.  We can clearly see that the presence of K-12 public education hasn't led to the abolition of private schools -- they are still alive and well. As such  the presence of a universal basic healthcare system doesn't necessarily have to imply the annihilation of private insurance companies. There are plenty of developed nations that offer both  like the UK. In the UK everyone is covered by a public system but people can pay extra for insurance that gives them access to private doctors. I'm not sure why this is such a radical concept to some Americans. Maybe it's because this is all we've ever known -- I'm not sure. Either way  the economy won't flourish if people are too sick to contribute to it. And if the United States continues on the path it's on  this won't be an untenable consequence.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.04927106227106228,16994,

It doesn't take any resources for someone to not attack you. In fact  you have the right to not be bodily attacked.

The thing is  just because our government has done a poor job building roadways in the past doesn’t mean we shouldn’t bother building them altogether or that the solution is to privatize them and charge a fee for driving. We should look to other nations that have built more efficient systems and fix what went wrong here. Immediately eliminating the role of government doesn’t necessarily imply that the quality of the good will be better  especially when it is something that is objectively of utilitarian value (like a roadway  a metro system  and yes  healthcare). Also  a universal basic healthcare system doesn’t automatically mean you don’t have the freedom to seek out supplemental insurance if you aren’t satisfied with the quality of care you are receiving. In fact most socialized medical systems offer supplemental private insurance because they are situated in nations with capitalist economies. So you would have the freedom to seek out care you see fit for your Congestive Heart Failure or Chronic Renal Disease. Unfortunately these are classified as preexisting conditions according to most private insurance companies  so most will deny you coverage if your medical documents show record of one or both and you will have to pay out of pocket anyway  which may mean receiving no care at all. Wouldn’t it be nice to at least have a system to fall back on?

I’m glad to hear that I’m not the only one who ever came up with this idea- that at least means it’s not completely crazy  I think.  I have some responses to what you wrote.  “Declaring healthcare a human right does not somehow infringe upon the individual rights of healthcare professionals because no one is demanding that they practice medicine  nor is anyone demanding that they practice it for free.” I think this answer is just begging the question. We are discussing whether someone is ever entitled to someone else’s labor and using healthcare as an example.  You seem to be saying that because a person voluntarily entered the field of medicine that they must accept another person’s right to their labor  or else they can leave and go do something else.  That argument just assumes the thing you are trying to prove- whether or not it is ok for people to claim a right to someone else’s labor.   I think to prove the correctness of that idea  you need to go in another direction. Another thing- even if your proposition wasn’t just begging the question  wouldn’t you be also (maybe involuntarily) saying that the performance of any job leaves one exposed to a public claim on that work whenever society feels that the work is sufficiently necessary to the public at large?  Maybe you’re not saying this  but I wonder on what grounds you could argue against such a claim.  For example  what if we as a society decided that iPhones are necessary for everyone to fully function as a citizen and have a reasonable quality of life?  We claim that “iPhones are a human right”. Your argument would then say that “No one is forcing Apple to make iPhones. They are free to make any product they like” while still demanding that as long as Apple makes iPhones  they should provide them to everyone since we decided that we “have a right” to them.  Would you support demanding that from Apple in that circumstance?     I realize you specifically said that no one is demanding that doctors practice for free  which actually leads to my next issue I wanted to cover. “public K-12 schools versus private” First  do you want a health care system that performs as well as the American public education system?  I am a product of that system and I don’t think it’s all bad  but a quick look at American ranking in education worldwide should temper the desire to handicap our health care system more than it already is.   The real issue is the cost.  I’m fine with the idea of a universal public option for health care (which kind of exists already thanks to EMTALA)  but the hard truth is that if costs of drugs and treatments don’t change  providing a maximal level of care to every person in America will bankrupt the whole system.  This isn’t even close to an issue about doctor reimbursement  which constantly goes down.  Two years ago one of the most common procedures that I do took a 40% hit in reimbursement.  Forty percent.  One year we got $10 for the procedure  the next we got $6 (figuratively speaking).  Try running your business with those kind of hits coming every few years.  If you want a public system that doesn’t bankrupt the country  then at least one of two things can happen.  Either we can decrease the cost of the drugs  fees  tests  etc.  or we can refrain from offering all treatments to all people.  The latter is horrendous.  “I’m sorry Mr. Jones  but the public health plan doesn’t cover dialysis for people over 65.  Your wife has a few days to live until she dies of kidney failure.” Ugh. Hopefully if this is the plan chosen then an administrator will be asked to have those conversations instead of the doctors.  The second option- decreasing the cost of all the parts of the healthcare system is at least more ethical  I think.  It does mean asking private companies to decrease their profits “just because”.  Given the obscene profits of the pharmaceutical companies that might seem more palatable.  But what about this- what if the pharma companies are told to decrease their prices and they have already done all they can to streamline the production of a drug and can’t sell it for less and still be profitable?  Do we demand that they continue to make it at a loss?  That sounds like a terrible idea- pretty sure that kind of thinking is how Venezuela got to where it is now.  If I was the company and I couldn’t make a profit on a thing  then my next move would be to stop making that thing.  So now maybe instead of merely being expensive  the drug in question is just unavailable.  Not sure that is much of a solution.  That would be the natural consequence of declaring the right to a person’s voluntary labor though- they may just quit volunteering.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.06822922447922447,17010,

When the state gives the right  the state also is responsible for making sure that right is protected. our 'right to liberty' would mean nothing if the state didn't maintain a military to prevent invasion and protect the freedom. Our right to life would mean nothing if the state was not able to protect the sanctity of that life by making sure the police force exists. I don't understand how that is different from healthcare then. In fact  in my opinion  healthcare ties in directly to right to life.  &#x200B;  Right to fair trial does not mean that the defendant is allowed to choose the most expensive lawyer and bill them for hours of work at exhorbitant fees. The right to fair trial means that if the defendant is unable to pay for a lawyer  the state pays for one and this is usually taken care of through an office of public defendants. Why then can't we separate public and private healthcare. A reasonable healthcare should be available to all through public hospitals. Should the rich find it lacking in comfort or wish for a treatment that falls outside of the normal paradigm of care  they can choose to get private insurance and go to private hospitals. This is how most countries do it and i don't think any healthcare professionals in any of those countries have complained that they are being enslaved by being forced to provide their services. They are paid for those services as professionals usually are.   &#x200B;  There are established protocals on how a heart failure patient will be managed. As long as the care falls within that normal paradigm  it should be accessible to everyone. If the patient wishes to have only branded medication (as opposed to generic) or wishes to have treatment only in a private room with 800 thread count sheets  they can choose to go private.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.0918030753968254,17011,

If the US had a national health system  more people would be able to seek out healthcare services. We charge waaaay too much over here! The physicians I know who were trained in the UK had similar training to their US counterparts still make a comfortable living. It’s not like they are giving away their services for free  they get paid through taxes from the NHS.   Imagine being an employed tax paying American citizen  whose job doesn’t provide health insurance. You make too much for Medicaid  but the market place plans are too expensive.  Those people have come into my urgent care and end up with $150 bill for sinusitis  plus cost of prescription at pharmacy. The same visit for me (with insurance) is $20 copay- 87% less than the out of pocket cost Hopefully they don’t end up needing that fancy aortic balloon!  So to answer your questions: yes  I think tax paying American citizens receiving healthcare in America have an absolute right to receive all of those healthcare services you mentioned. Health care services are considered expensive because the producers/people determine price are getting greedy trying to make a profit. I doubt the aortic balloon costs anywhere near $50k to produce.

And I think that when most people say “healthcare is a right” their intentions are to establish a political mandate that would fulfill that  as opposed to an argument regarding what rights are and aren’t. I personally think if the discussion primarily becomes an examination of natural rights then the argument is not addressed in terms of what is actually being promoted by the left (namely a policy initiative  not a philosophical doctrine). So I may not be the best person to address some of your questions  but I will give you my thoughts nonetheless.  &#x200B;  I don’t think your iPhone example is a strong enough parallel to healthcare (unlike the relationship between healthcare and public K-12 education).

That’s why we would never (and have not) declared them a “human right.” I don’t think you can just pick random goods out of a hat and attempt to compare them to healthcare or education when they don’t function similarly at all. Most of the time when I see people do this they seem to be asking “if this becomes a right then what else is next” without considering the stark differences between what we are calling a “right” and what they are proposing we would call a “right” in the future. It just ends up sounding silly. And while I do get that the quality of public K-12 education in this country is severely lacking (which can be attributed to a lack of funding)  it’s frightening to imagine how much worse off we’d be if we left it exclusively to the free market. The median household income in 2016 was $59 039. In my neighborhood there is a private boarding school that costs $43 390 a year in tuition. Do you realize the percentage of Americans that wouldn’t even be able to attend Kindergarten? What sorts of consequences do you think that would pose to our nation’s economic stability? I’m not sure about you but I’d certainly rather see what we have today (even if it’s not perfect) than the kind of society that would create. It’s one thing to sit from the comfort of our home and have a philosophical discussion regarding natural rights (while using a historically removed definition of slavery  mind you)  but when you actually look at the day-to-day consequences of such a proposition it’s legitimately quite scary.  &#x200B;  I won’t claim to know more than you about healthcare costs because you’re a physician and I’m not. However  it is a fact that Americans pay more for health care and  yet  on most health outcome measures under-perform compared to other industrialized countries. And if you’re concerned about debt you should also note that The UK  with its single-payer National Health Service  has a debt-to-GDP ratio of 87 percent  while Germany (with a single-payer hybrid system) carries one of the lowest debt ratios among the large  industrialized economies at 64 percent. However  according to the International Monetary Fund  the U.S. has one of the highest debt-to-GDP ratios in the world (108). In fairness  there are genuine problems the U.S. would face if it tried to replicate a single-payer system such as those in the U.K. and Europe. The vested interests enriched by the U.S. health care system are large and powerful — pharmaceutical companies  physicians  medical equipment manufacturers  insurance companies — and would all be adversely affected by the implementation of any form of universal health care  be it a single-payer system or a public-private hybrid (such as in Germany). I think you alluded to this toward the end of your reply. For example  it’s a fact that U.S. physicians are paid twice as much  on average  as physicians in other wealthy countries. Keep in mind that doctors in other wealthy countries don’t pay to attend medical school  so they don’t need to earn as high of a salary as doctors here do to maintain a comparable (if not better) standard of living because they aren’t paying off six figures in student loan debt. What’s even more pressing though is not the salary of doctors but the fact that U.S. pharmaceutical companies aren’t subjected to sufficient price competition. This is because U.S. law prohibits Medicare from negotiating prices directly with drug companies  drug companies game the system to block generic competition and keep drug prices up  and drug companies pass on the costs of research and development to American consumers. This cycle continues when pharmaceutical companies finance political candidates who then protect (and enhance) their economic interests any way they can. This is probably why you will see that most candidates who are supporting a single-payer system don’t take money from pharmaceutical companies or corporate interests. When you keep all of this in mind it becomes much easier to see how interwoven all of this really is and what it’s really all about — corporate power and greed. We simply don’t have our priorities straight. And I really think our time would be better served crafting a plan to make this potentially possible because people are dying as we speak. I’d rather retreat from armchair philosophy if it means changing that  and I hope as a physician you would too.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.10189138576779024,17020,

They can expedite the applications  you just have to make the case a priority for them.  If you have a credit card  buy the meds.  If California is like maryland  once the application is approved it should back date eligibility  but regardless at least you would have the meds on the CC. I would also consider filing for disability if you can. that isn't exactly a short term answer tho,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",-0.06666666666666668,17035,

In the papers when I read about the debate over healthcare it's always presented as single payer vs private cover  ie an either/or situation.   But in Australia we have both: on the one hand we have Medicare which is universal coverage for all and everyone pays the Medicare levy which is 2% of their income.  However everyone also has the option of taking out private health cover on top of that if they want it. You even get a 30% rebate on your premiums from the government for doing so  because it's said to take some pressure off the public system.   (To be clear the public system is in fact excellent  and there are no crazy long queues to get urgent healthcare or substandard hospital rooms. The last time I was in a public hospital in 2018  I got my own room with colour TV  air conditioning and a bathroom. They are all moving to this model because it reduces the risk of infections spreading ie when patients are isolated. all the best surgeons work in the public sector because it's so big and well-funded. so when you need complex surgery you are usually shifted to a public hospital anyway if you are a private patient.)

We have Medicaid and Medicare. You have to qualify with either income  age or disability. Otherwise you HAVE to pay for insurance or go without and heaven forbid you get sick or have a medical emergency. Healthcare is expensive and if I understand correctly it doesn’t cross state lines. The pricing is not regulated at any level other than each hospital  meaning each hospital has its own price/charge method. Medicare and Medicaid have rules for payment and it’s complex. So complex you need analysts to figure out the rules to extract the data to give to the government. Also  they don’t pay well and can deny payment based on their rules/regulations. That’s just high level. So many go without insurance due to cost. Also  when you have insurance on top of your premiums you may have deductibles  out of pocket  etc. it’s all based on payment.

This idea of ""free market"" is so American  but most don't understand how the concept does not work in healthcare. Insurers do NOT want to compete for sick people. THEY WANT TO COMPETE FOR HEALTHY PEOPLE. Sick people have claims. Claims cut into profits.   &#x200B;  Natural capitalist forces are always trying to find ways NOT to insure sick people. If I sell sneakers  I want you to buy the heck of them and come back and buy more. If I sell insurance  I want you to buy it and NOT use it. I make more money that way. And if you do use your insurance a lot  I want to find ways to get rid of you.  No judgment. Just honest analysis of capitalism and health insurance.  So how do we insure sick people if the insurance companies don't want them and will do what they can to avoid paying their medical claims?  We've reached a critical mass where something has to change.  Americans are just starting to wake up. Insurance has ""cost-shifted"" so much of the expense onto the consumer that we're breaking. My husband and I have a high-deductible plan. We pay $1350/month for this insurance. And we have to pay the first $11 000 of our medical bills before insurance pays. Absolutely ridiculous.  Perhaps politicians are going whole hog on single-payer because we are suffering so much  and most Americans do not understand how our health insurance system works. It's VERY complicated.   We have 4 systems:   Private insurance  Medicare  a kind of single-payer  Veteran's Administration (like England - gov't owned hospitals  gov't paid doctors)  Cash  (There's Medicaid  CHIP  the Indian Health Service and maybe more  but they fall under gov't run insurance)  On top of all this  we have out-of-control prices  drug prices  politics and lobbyists pouring tons of money into politicians' coffers to protect their interests.   Bottom Line. Americans are broken. That's why politicians are making healthcare an issue.

IMO there is not a GOOD reason why both cannot exist alongside each other.   Medicare for all sounds great on a surface level only. Once you actually examine the issue in any depth whatsoever it becomes really evident that it’s a very complicated issue.   For example  studies regarding health outcomes based on public vs private insurance have yielded mixed results. Methodologies differ and there isn’t really consensus on correct methodology  so from a quality perspective either conservative or liberal rhetoric could be correct.   From a reimbursement perspective it matters a lot though  and I suspect on a large enough scale reimbursement would have a negative effect on quality as well. Currently in America the government options reimburse at something like 30% the rate of private insurers on average.  When hospital executives recently responded to question regarding their ability to continue to operate if all of their patients paid at Medicare rates  it’s not at all hyperbole when they say they’d have to shut down.   A lot of folks on the liberal side of the aisle might believe hospital administrators are simply too used to their cushy budgets  and in some cases that’s absolutely true. There’s tons of opportunity for fraud or mismanagement of funds in the current system. However there’s also the cases of critical access hospitals constantly trimming costs just to keep the lights on. These hospitals are rural  and are essentially healthcare outposts  providing limited care in areas that would otherwise be ‘healthcare deserts’ for lack of a better term.  Recently a lot of these hospital have ‘partnered with’ aka been sold to larger health systems that can afford to operate these locations at a loss because they’re unable to operate any longer on their own.  These locations have payor bases made up almost entirely of Medicare patients  and it’s not particularly surprising to anyone that they barely subsist.   Conversely  folks on the conservative side of the aisle worry about the expense of all the new patients receiving care on the governments dime  and in some respects they’re right to worry. One thing that government insurance indisputably excels at is providing access to care  which is a super important thing  and in my opinion was one of the best achievements of Obamacare. Suddenly you have a lot more people visiting PCPs that were not doing so previously  and those PCPs are now probably experiencing a poorer level of reimbursement on average because as we previously stated  Medicare simply doesn’t reimburse at the level of private insurers.   On the other hand  a significant portion of those people that are now showing up at the PCP were probably showing up at the Emergency Room previously  when shit was really bad for them. Especially in urban areas  folks without coverage at all commonly utilize hospital emergency rooms as their de facto PCP because they have nowehere else to turn. ED visits are exponentially more expensive than PCP visits  and don’t really do anything to address needs beyond the immediate reason for the visit. Emergency Departments frequently operate deeply in the negative in urban areas as a result. Medicare for all probably does quite a lot to relieve the expense of currently uninsured patients that currently show up  receive care  and then never pay  because they simply can’t. This expense is probably dicking over PCPs by shifting costs onto them  which sucks and is a problem that needs to be solved in any Medicare for all solution.   One huge opportunity for cost improvement that doesn’t get talked about enough is requiring public and private insurance to play by the same rules when it comes to billing. Medicare is pretty notorious for constantly changing their requirements for certain reimbursements to be paid. Failure to provide documentation of meeting these requirements in precisely the right way can result in the entire reimbursement for a visit to be denied. Not so bad for an office visit for example  but if you had a 4 night hospital stay that’s a lot of money for the hospital to get shafted on. This has had the effect of hospital hiring on entire departments specifically to manager and monitor documentation requirements are being met in precisely the correct way  and working with care teams to adjust documentation when required in order to get paid by Medicare. You would these these documentation requirements would be really important things for ensuring good patient outcomes  and sometimes they are. Many times though they’re almost entirely beauracratic in nature; simply boxes to be checked off by the care team where failure to do so has no impact on the patient but major impacts on reimbursement.  Furthermore  consider that private insurers frequently do not follow Medicare requirements for reimbursement  but have their own sets of rules. This means potentially new sets of rules for your paperwork for every payor your hospital is contracted with. The effect is that hospitals now dedicate a very significant portion of staff expenditure to PAPERWORK  when it should be spent on staff that are involved with patient care. In fact this overhead has grown SO MUCH that there’s a sub industry of business that are contracted by hospitals to manage their billing  claims  and reimbursements  and hospital and physician billing are separate services to boot.  So much cost has been introduced by these practices and in many cases it has not resulted in any tangible benefits to patients.   Developing a unified set of billing rules that all payors  public or private  agree and adhere to would greatly cut down on billing complexity and help hospitals begin reducing expenditures on administrative overhead. Furthermore  if universal codified billing rules exist  this means you can eliminate huge amounts of positions dedicated to the mire ph hospital billing by automating these processes in EMR systems. This cannot be done today due to the vast number of differences that exist between payors  and state and federal government rules. The technology exists now.   On the other hand  automating hospital billing with computer systems means a significant loss of jobs. I’ve read somewhere that estimates over a million jobs exist due to complexities in medical billing practices in the United States  and while it would be great for everyone to reduce that overhead  it would also result in a large and sudden unemployment of a significant number of people that work in that niche today.   Pharmaceuticals are sort of tied into our shitty insurance system   and it’s impossibly complicated  but I’ll just say that personally big pharma are both criminals and cartels  and even if conservative politicians are correct on the need to preserve their current practices for economic reasons  the pharma industry is full of crooks  and I’ve for relatively little sympathy for anyone employed there  and they need to be regulated to the very edge of bankruptcy or until they get the message to stop fucking anyone around. Big telecom is getting antitrust attention currently  but big pharma probably deserves it much more.   There’s other topics but honestly I’m pretty spent. In general I’d say any plan to immediately switch everyone to a public option is doomed to fail. A public/private combo is necessary  at least in the short term  and the government needs to address its ability to be competitive with other large payors unless we want to see a large decline in services in quality.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.05896075347514197,17059,

Being able to buy additional private coverage on top of a mandatory universal system (like in your country  or the UK) isnt the same as having an optional public plan that you could choose whether or not to participate in. But youre totally right  talking about “abolishing private insurance” is a confusing and bad way to frame that difference.  As an aside  we have pretty much the situation you described in our Medicare program... you have a base level of coverage through medicare and can choose to pay an extra premium to purchase additional coverage through the private health insurance companies  this is called “Medicare Advantage” or “Part C”. Its becoming very popular and more and more old people choose to do private MA over the public version every year. Some of the private plans are so efficient (mainly through HMOs which limit you to one hospital system for non-emergency care) that they dont even charge a premium  so you can choose a private plan without paying any extra.

They have the best facilities  equipment and economies of scale. most importantly it's where all the best surgeons are at.

Doctors are free to charge what they want. They can choose to take just the Medicare rebate  or choose to charge more than that and leave patients with out of pocket costs. You can guess what happens. It's most obvious in general practice. We have what are knows as ""bulk billers"". These are clinics which just take the Medicare rebate and charge nothing more. The patient pays zero and there's no extra costs. Then there are clinics which charge excess fees for whatever reason. Maybe they're open at 11PM on Sunday night.

In the papers when I read about the debate over healthcare it's always presented as single payer vs private cover  ie an either/or situation.   But in Australia we have both: on the one hand we have Medicare which is universal coverage for all and everyone pays the Medicare levy which is 2% of their income.  However everyone also has the option of taking out private health cover on top of that if they want it. You even get a 30% rebate on your premiums from the government for doing so  because it's said to take some pressure off the public system.   (To be clear the public system is in fact excellent  and there are no crazy long queues to get urgent healthcare or substandard hospital rooms. The last time I was in a public hospital in 2018  I got my own room with colour TV  air conditioning and a bathroom. They are all moving to this model because it reduces the risk of infections spreading ie when patients are isolated. all the best surgeons work in the public sector because it's so big and well-funded. so when you need complex surgery you are usually shifted to a public hospital anyway if you are a private patient.)

The Australian system at least balances out in the private insurance side with controlled costs through the public option.

The other 0.5% is to fund the national disability insurance scheme  which covers you for things like equipment & care plan costs in case you develop a disability. (It's not the disability support pension which is funded from general revenue.) And you only start paying it if you make more than about $23K a year so people on low incomes are covered for free.  I guess my point is that young people starting out often on lower incomes and healthy do get a break to some extent. And everyone understands that even though you start off young  we all get old and will likely need health care in the future  which your Medicare levy helps to fund. Medicare is kind of like superannuation for your health.  And remember Medicare also covers GP visits and on the side there's the pharmaceutical benefits scheme which gives us subsidised medicine.

From standpoint of pure business operations  private is doing it better than public by a long way currently. I’d love for it be reversed  but that’s a long process for us to get there   and it unfortunately doesn’t happen just by switching to a Medicare for all option.

Definitely scary to think about nationalization of healthcare  but if that were to happen immediately I can only imagine that costing several trillions of dollars to acquire the facilities  over a million jobs lost in the medical insurance and billing industries  an immediate scramble by currently uncovered patients to sign up with PCPs and probably a significant increase in wait times to be seen. There would be a shortage care team staff  schedulers  and actual physical space for folks that need to be treated that would desire for immediate treatment. I would imagine burnout only becomes more of a problem for care team members; we’re currently understaffed at a national level for both nurses and physicians and suddenly increasing the population of covered patients would certainly put a strain on our system.  Not sure how pharma plays into this  but our government would certainly hold a negotiation advantage orders of magnitude better than anyone has today so I imagine pharmaceutical costs and medical supply costs to hospitals would drop. I suspect our transplant wait lists would rise by a notable amount. In the slightly longer term I suspect a great deal of administrative staff would lose their jobs. Government run hospitals means it would be more efficient to consolidate hospital IT systems for example  to unified platforms across all locations. Whichever vendors were selected for lab systems  EMR systems  billing solutions  imaging solutions  etc would become effective monopolies in the US  and this might even have the effect of hurting competition globally. So you’d have this secondary wave of job losses and likely business closures  for all vendors that find themselves losing the lottery to provider various administrative software or services to the government. From an IT systems perspective alone we have several vendors that are generating several billions of dollars annually.  I suppose the same becomes true for manufacturers of medical supplies or equipment that are small or highly specialized. Any of these businesses that fail to win government contracts are likely going out of business  and taking lots of jobs with them.  Similar for the pharma industry even. Manufacturing employees are probably safeish  but the scores of pharmaceutical marketing specialists and sale people probably all get canned (though admittedly I have far less sympathy for them).   I’m sure there are loads of issues I’ve failed to even recognize here  but hopefully that illustrates some of the problems that would be created by an immediate changeover to a nationalized model. Over time I suspect things stabilize  but even solely from a job loss perspective this seems like a losing proposition  IMO.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.08290372670807455,17081,

In the papers when I read about the debate over healthcare it's always presented as single payer vs private cover  ie an either/or situation.   But in Australia we have both: on the one hand we have Medicare which is universal coverage for all and everyone pays the Medicare levy which is 2% of their income.  However everyone also has the option of taking out private health cover on top of that if they want it. You even get a 30% rebate on your premiums from the government for doing so  because it's said to take some pressure off the public system.   (To be clear the public system is in fact excellent  and there are no crazy long queues to get urgent healthcare or substandard hospital rooms.

If you're on a high income over $90K there's a surcharge  around 1% I think  which you do not pay if you have private health cover. Medicare also funds GP visits. there's also the pharmaceutical benefits scheme which subsidizes medicines. it's funded from general revenue though.

377,AdverseEffect,[Discussion] The Memphis hospital suing its own workers for unpaid medical bills | US news,I live in the State of GA. Two years ago  I went to the emergency room. Long after the fact  I received an EOB from my insurance company saying the wouldn't pay. I appealed and the appeal was denied. They said they couldn't pay it for the way the emergency room described it and they considered it a non emergency. The hospital did in fact describe it completely wrong. That's not what happened at all.  I also get calls from the hospital's billing department EVERY DAY for the last two years.  Recently  my doctor requested an MRI for me and the hospital system wouldn't do it unless I paid a third of what I owed them which I couldn't afford.,https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/pQV0hL-bnKodr4Vkz6h1GmapvPxKzUZDb_n3RiIN9gQ.jpg,No video,2019-06-29 08:15:56,11.0,29.0,10.0,robertredberry,Well  I was off by a lot.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.0,17103,

Health insurance safeguards you against large medical Bill's that will put you into bankruptcy.  There are some details you should look at when choosing a plan each year. 1.) Premiums  deductibles  copays  coinsurance  and out of pocket maximums. 2.)network (who takes the insurance) 3.) How much are you willing to risk financially?  when I was 26 .y employer had a similar plan through Cigna that was $18 a check  4k deductible and 5k out of pocket limit that included the deductible  Also it had an HSA.  So I chose that since it was very affordable and capped my costs at under 5500 a year if I had the worst year of my life medically.  I also put in money that I saved from the difference in premium costs  into the HSA.  This allowed me to have quite a bit saved up. This was instead of me choosing a 250 deductible plan that cost $300 a check. This is money that I would have paid but ended up not using it.  A couple years of saving and I changed my insurance to the other plan offerings because I needed to start seeing some specialists. But I had 6k in HSA savings that I could use or save for an emergency.   So instead of over insuring myself in years of good health  I saved money rather than give it to an insurance company.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.03379120879120879,17104,0.0

I think some states fund this partly on their own  but it is mostly am ACA initiative. Participation is voluntary for hospitals   clinics  etc... But it's not very voluntary if your funding source wants you to participate.  For patients  you have to sign a release if your detailed records will appear on the exchange  but things like admissions data  including diagnosis  can be uploaded without your consent.  For instance   I work at XYZ big hospital.   Patient Jo is brought in by ambulance  in bad shape from some unknown disease.  I look Jo up on the HIE and can see other in-state ER visits  surgery admits  hospital stays  and some basic demographic info like maybe previous addresses or emergency contacts or insurance info   if Jo went to a clinic that participated in the HIE and he consented to their releasing his records  I might be able to see old notes from Dr visits  his med list  etc..

When acid reflux occurs more than twice a week it is determined as Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).   * Acid reflux is when some of the acid content of the stomach flows back to the esophagus  into the gullet  which moves food down from the mouth.

This is an incredibly important time for her and she wants to make sure that she is choosing the best option and usually at the best price but this is the one time in her life (most likely) that she will be able to get into any policy without preexisting conditions or exclusions and underwriting which could save her a substantial amount of money.   &#x200B;  She should be receiving or have already received her Medicare card (red  white and blue card)  in the mail. If she is wanting full Medicare coverage she should have signed up for Part A and Part B at least  so Confirm that the Parts A and B start dates on your card are correct in this case since her birthday is in August they should be set for Aug 1st  2019. If you are not receiving Social Security benefits  you will most likely not be automatically enrolled in your Part B. You can verify your status or sign up for Part B by contacting Social Security.   To apply for Medicare/retirement benefits  visit the official Social Security website here: •  [https://secure.ssa.gov/iClaim/rib](https://secure.ssa.gov/iClaim/rib)   To apply for Social Security benefits  visit the official Social Security website here: •  [https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/retirement/](https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/retirement/)   &#x200B;  From there she will also need to sign up for a Part D  prescription drug benefits plan.  &#x200B;  It's likely in your research you will also come across Part C or Advantage Plans (Low premium plans) and I would preemptively tell you to HEAVILY research before going down this route as while there are a few that have received decent reviews and for some select people they may be the best or only choice  but for most they find out only AFTER getting the policy when they actually need it that choosing a Part C means you have sold your Medicare Part A and Part B rights to a private insurance company. This is an alternative to Original Medicare  not a supplement.  That means a private insurance company is who makes determinations as to whether you are covered  not the federally mandated standards of Medicare (which are FAR more lenient and patient forward) and most are only localized and will not cover you if you need specialists out of your area or who do not take that individual carrier as opposed to the 90%+ of other hospitals and Drs who accept Original Mediare and supplements.   &#x200B;  Without knowing her specific health background or her regular healthcare routines it would be hard to make a more complete assessment but generally these days the Plan G supplement is considered the best coverage to value and the Plan F High Deductible (soon to be replaced with the Plan G High Deductible) for those of incredibly good health simply looking for catastrophic coverage in case of major unforeseen medical expense who don't want to pay much out of pocket monthly.   &#x200B;  For a more descriptive breakdown of standardized Plans and coverages  you can review here: •   [https://www.medicare.gov/supplements-other-insurance/how-to-compare-medigap-policies](https://www.medicare.gov/supplements-other-insurance/how-to-compare-medigap-policies)   &#x200B;  Hopefully this helps  if you have more specific questions  I'll do my best to address them.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.19759401709401705,17162,0.116

My parents seem to think that if I don't make at least $12k in income in 2019  I won't be able to pay for ANY health insurance in 2020. I have enough savings in my bank account that I'd be able to afford the full priced $450/month Oscar health insurance for next year  even without the stipend. But my parents are panicking because they think that I'm not eligible for any Obamacare plan  even if I can afford it  if I have not made at least $12k in 2019. I live in Texas  and apparently if you make under $12k  you're only eligible for Medicaid  but we don't have that here apparently?  This seems absurd to me. Does anyone know the answer here?,self,No video,2019-06-26 12:38:21,4.0,3.0,3.0,drewdles151515,Ok thank you so much. You’re saying what I thought was true all along.

They were put in place precisely to protect against price gouging and monopolies.  But it has to be balanced and reviewed constantly.  Lets use a orthopedic and rehab hospital as an example.  In Maryland we have CON laws that limit how many surgical and rehab facilities are allowed to exist  because at one point there were 100s and the market was saturated (those procedures and the rehab after received extremely high reimbursement.  Hospitals that used to rely on that income now didn't have that as an option and had to close down  leaving certain areas in the state without an emergency room or L&D center (some of the lowest reimbursed services.   So Maryland passed CON laws controlling how many orthopedic and rehab hospitals are allowed and also required them to provide other certain mandatory services. This more equally spreads reimbursement costs funding hospitals and helping decrease a lack of services in rural areas. There are examples of certain states that got rid of CON laws and effectively many hospitals closed/went bankrupt because of the influx of specialty service facilities that took all the reimbursements.  Without the hospitals many rural areas have no option for care and eventually people move and then the speciality hospitals actually close down to then because there is no marker.  It's a weird cycle that does repeat itself. There are many examples of pros and cons of CON laws  it is a complicated process and balancing act for countries that dont have government run facilities.   I definitely agree that certain things can be loosened  but deregulation is not the answer to control costs.  Fixing reimbursement models and funding hospitals with consistent payment models would address this specific issue  which could then allow for a relaxing of CON laws.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.12042429792429793,17172,

Every citizen gets a Health Savings Account.   1) fed gov puts in a certain amount every year  say $5000 for purposes of discussion.    2)  all employee benefits for health care stop and everything goes into that account (i.e. my company pays 15k per year for my health care    get them the hell out of my health care and deciding who my doctor is and what plan I get.   That 15k per year also goes into my HSA in addition to the fed gov money).     3)  I do whatever the hell I want with that money (for health care).  It only goes for health care like HSAs already do.  If I want insurance with that  i buy insurance with that.  If I want to let the money ride  I do that.  If mcdonalds and walmart are offering McDoctors  I might use them.       3) don't tax the HSAs.    It is the ultimate perfect solution to american health care.   Let competition rip  everyone fights for your business.   Get employers out of health care (by far the most stupid system imaginable).    I'd still have government oversight because health care is highly exploitable.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",-0.01880952380952381,17183,-0.222

The individual was part of the plan. Let's say they paid into tier 2. So 80% of that $15 000 is covered  $12 000. Then hopefully they have either supplemental insurance through work that covers additional 10%-20%. So let's say covers 20% of that $3 000 now  $600. Now they have an HSA with max contribution being $3 000. They can use $2 400 to cover and pay for the hospital bill.  Maybe if we could lessen that $15 000 by figuring ways to reduce that cost. Medical patents  malpractice  increase the financial return for hospital visits  tax reforms  and so forth. Could make that $15 000  hypothetically  be say $6 000. So $1 200 is covered. Another $240 is covered. So $960 is only paid out of pocket.  Do think there should be an 8% tax for healthcare.

Whereas apps like Headspace and Calm are focused on meditation and mindfulness  newer platforms such as BetterHelp  a subsidiary of Teladoc and leader in the online therapy space (makes sense) and [**Talkspace**](https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/29/talkspace-picks-up-50-million-series-d/https:/techcrunch.com/2019/05/29/talkspace-picks-up-50-million-series-d/)  which recently raised $50 million and is partnering with Optum  are bringing counseling and therapy services directly to your phone.  &#x200B;  **Mental Health’s growth.**  The apps point to a larger trend. The mental and behavioral health industry is growing like wildfire and is projected to continue at a 7% clip through 2024. Just last week  Anthem acquired Beacon Health  a huge behavioral health organization.  &#x200B;  **Easy Money.**  Now  mental health startups like BetterHelp  Talkspace  and Quartet Health are popping up. Just this week  the startup [**announced**](https://www.builtinnyc.com/2019/06/17/quartet-health-series-d-funding) a successful $60 million Series D funding round courtesy of Centene (another big Medicaid player). To date  Quartet Health has raised almost $153 million so far  which is only one example of not only the deep pockets of healthcare venture capital  but also the ease of fundraising in 2019.  ##   ## Are Patients a big part of the U.S. healthcare spending problem?  **Fat Americans.**  An interesting article this week brought up a fascinating topic of discussion: should consumers be blamed at all for the high cost of healthcare in the U.S?   &#x200B;  **I’ll take a Big Mac.**  The Atlantic article [**published**](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/07/american-health-care-spending/590623/) this week argued that Americans have unhealthy behaviors rooted in cultural norms  which leads to poorer outcomes for the population (hello  pizza night!). It goes on to state that Americans tend to be over-treated  disregard preventive and routine care  undergo dangerous elective surgeries  and treat physicians like deities. It concludes that a high cost healthcare system is enabled by the poor healthcare choices made by Americans.  The story only covers the consumer side of the healthcare cost argument  but it’s an interesting perspective  and one not touched on as often.

Of course  the big ticket item this year was whether or not the AMA would support any single payer  or as the media so fondly calls it  ‘Medicare for All’ proposal. While the vote was ultimately struck down  it was much closer than most expected – 53% of participants voted against the policy.  In other developments  the AMA voted to [**adopt more technology and A.I. friendly policies**](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/ama-adopts-measures-to-shape-development-uptake-of-ai-systems-in-healthcar/556819/)  including working toward developing applications for A.I. in healthcare  technology training for physicians  and generally deeper integration of tech in healthcare.  ##   ## Pfizer buys Array Biopharma in huge $11.4 billion deal  In a deal that led to an across the board biotech rally  Pfizer announced its intention to [**acquire Array BioPharma**](https://investors.pfizer.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2019/Pfizer-to-Acquire-Array-BioPharma/default.aspx) for a total of $11.4 billion  or $48 per share – which is a gigantic 60ish% premium over its most recent share price.  Array was a pretty attractive buyout option given its super innovative cancer therapies along with its licensed revenues and medicines.  It’s been a pretty good 30ish months for biotech M&A.  &#x200B;     ## California expands health insurance to illegal immigrants  **On the taxpayers’ dime?!?!?!**  This week  California [**unveiled**](https://www.axios.com/california-health-benefits-for-some-immigrants-8b7e6ab0-0b3e-4674-9aec-5248ce1ee42c.html) a public health plan that would be made available for illegal immigrants in the state. The plan would more or less be an extension of Medicaid and is expected to cover about 90 000 19 to 25 year old individuals.

492,key-va,[News] Nurex isn't waiting for the U.S healthcare system to magically fix itself.,&#x200B;  ## Therapy through your Phone  and the growth of the mental health industry.  **Therapy as a Service.**  A slew of mental health apps have been making their way through the app store and onto people’s phones in a big way. Whereas apps like Headspace and Calm are focused on meditation and mindfulness  newer platforms such as BetterHelp  a subsidiary of Teladoc and leader in the online therapy space (makes sense) and [**Talkspace**](https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/29/talkspace-picks-up-50-million-series-d/https:/techcrunch.com/2019/05/29/talkspace-picks-up-50-million-series-d/)  which recently raised $50 million and is partnering with Optum  are bringing counseling and therapy services directly to your phone.  &#x200B;  **Mental Health’s growth.**  The apps point to a larger trend. The mental and behavioral health industry is growing like wildfire and is projected to continue at a 7% clip through 2024. Just last week  Anthem acquired Beacon Health  a huge behavioral health organization.  &#x200B;  **Easy Money.**  Now  mental health startups like BetterHelp  Talkspace  and Quartet Health are popping up. Just this week  the startup [**announced**](https://www.builtinnyc.com/2019/06/17/quartet-health-series-d-funding) a successful $60 million Series D funding round courtesy of Centene (another big Medicaid player). To date  Quartet Health has raised almost $153 million so far  which is only one example of not only the deep pockets of healthcare venture capital  but also the ease of fundraising in 2019.  ##   ## Are Patients a big part of the U.S. healthcare spending problem?  **Fat Americans.**  An interesting article this week brought up a fascinating topic of discussion: should consumers be blamed at all for the high cost of healthcare in the U.S?   &#x200B;  **I’ll take a Big Mac.**  The Atlantic article [**published**](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/07/american-health-care-spending/590623/) this week argued that Americans have unhealthy behaviors rooted in cultural norms  which leads to poorer outcomes for the population (hello  pizza night!). It goes on to state that Americans tend to be over-treated  disregard preventive and routine care  undergo dangerous elective surgeries  and treat physicians like deities. It concludes that a high cost healthcare system is enabled by the poor healthcare choices made by Americans.  The story only covers the consumer side of the healthcare cost argument  but it’s an interesting perspective  and one not touched on as often. Don’t forget – [**American’s aren’t exactly healthy**](http://medicalmatters.com/health-well-being/study-finds-97-3-americans-unhealthy/).

Of course  the big ticket item this year was whether or not the AMA would support any single payer  or as the media so fondly calls it  ‘Medicare for All’ proposal.

My reply is based on what I researched and learned from others in graduating classes before me and current fellows of sites I am interested in. Administrative fellowships are highly competitive BUT  there are so many of them. Sure you may want a spot at big names such as Mayo Clinic  Mass General  Cleveland Clinic  Kaiser Permanente  etc.  but unless you graduated from a top program or was an exceptional student with exceptional experiences like internships  presentations  case competitions  then your chances of a spot are very slim. In addition to what I said earlier  there are sites all over the nation that are overlooked and a good amount people do not apply to them because they want a spot at the ""best"" site.   &#x200B;  Administrative fellowships also give you a huge leg up when on the career hunt post-grad. It is the intention of most sites to keep you after completion. The best case scenario is that you complete your term and your site hires you for a director's role  administrator's role  VP  whatever role it may be that tie's into what you did during the fellowship. Worst case scenario  they don't keep you  BUT  you've gained experience  expanded your network  references  and a competitive advantage over someone that did not go through the same route.  &#x200B;  Sure the pay is on the lower side (55K-60K/yr) with some going as high as 70K or more (which is rare) than you would get if you went straight into let's say a director's role  but the big takeaway is what I mentioned earlier in the worst case scenario. Plus  your chances of landing a director's role is slim to none with just a degree and zero or not enough experience. You would have to start at an entry-level position  have a strong network  have prior experience  or a combination of all three before even being before potential employers consider you.   &#x200B;  I am not sure what your circumstances are  your experience  or the amount of education you have  but I'm speaking from a position of a current grad student of Masters of Health Administration and one w/ limited  relevant health care experience. I would try ACHE  org (AmericanCollegeof HealthcareExecutives) and look at their administrative fellowship section. Some of what I posted here came from there and more.

544,Blackthorn30,[Discussion] This is the cost of 3 months worth of insulin in the United States.,[Question - Other] [25F] I recently fell upon hard times. My mother passed away and I used a little money that she left me to buy a cheap used camper and a used truck. Thereafter  I left New England with my boyfriend in search of better job opportunities and a less expensive lifestyle  (about one year ago.) We're now living down south  just arrived in a new state a few weeks ago and I've now been experiencing multiple health problems that all seem to be unrelated but have surfaced at relatively the same time  effectively making me miserable.  2 weeks ago I started a new childcare job that I enjoy but doesn't pay much  and my bf started a new job as well  but he is in training for the first month or 2... so we are both working long hours and making very little money right now. We have not changed our address from up north yet as we live in our camper and move around every few months  and thus it has been difficult to arrange things like proper health care and vehicle registration/insurance.  We were making things work and getting along fine but then last weekend the transmission blew in our shared vehicle (which we use to tow our home and get to our jobs.) Okay so  no big deal  people are awesome down south and my bf's coworker has graciously agreed to pick him up for their job  and one of my coworkers has done the same for me.  We're SO freaking grateful  these people are an absolute godsend. Yet still we are finding it difficult to do things like grocery shop and finally get all these things done involving address change  health insurance  and what not  (which we were waiting for ourfirst paychecks in order to deal with  as were about a month behind on bills from our last move.) Also there is no hope of getting our vehicle fixed or finding a new one for at least a month due to the utter lack of finances.   I know I'm not the only person out there struggling with a catastrophic lifestyle shift and one thing after another getting in the way of health and happiness  so my question to you is: How does one cope with this?  TLDR; Should I hold off on going to the doctor until I can afford it or find insurance or potentially get my vehicle fixed? If not  how could I get there when I'm a city girl living in the country now with no car?

I know I'm not the only person out there struggling with a catastrophic lifestyle shift and one thing after another getting in the way of health and happiness  so my question to you is: How does one cope with this?  TLDR; Should I hold off on going to the doctor until I can afford it or find insurance or potentially get my vehicle fixed? If not  how could I get there when I'm a city girl living in the country now with no car?

563,BlueDarterz,[Question - Other] My Mother Needs a Liver Transplant  and She's Afraid the Cost Will Ruin Us,Hi  my name is Cullen  and I live in Maine and I'm 21. For 11 years my mother has been fighting Non-Hochkin's Lymphoma.  She's been through 8 rounds of chemo  since I began counting when I was 14  and 3 rounds of radiation.  We were recently told  in early May of this year  her cancer had gone into remission.  Yesterday morning  we got a call that has since made us all terrified for any number of reasons.  Mom was informed her Lymphoma has metastasized to her Liver.  We were informed she has two options: a liver transplant  or to risk getting plecebos in double blind clinical studies.  Neither of these are pleasant  and both are relatively expensive  the former exorbitantly so.  We were recently given 200k in grant money for Homesteading  building a farm/range essentially in Maine.  Our hopes were to purchase a farm house  and some land but now we're afraid to.  My aunt had her home levied 6 years ago to pay for a bypass surgery  and we're scared similar will happen should we purchase a home.  We're afraid they might demand payment the same day as the surgery  which while I think would be uncommon  I've had happen before.   From what my parents have told me  with all our insurance it only covers 40% of the cost  and looking online and seeing an approximation of 575 000$  for someone in college thats terrifying to think about.  My question for the people of r/healthcare is: can they take away our home?  If so  what else can they take from us?  Will they require us to pay the same day my mother has the surgery? What can we do to stop them?  How much is this surgery going to cost us?  Is there any advice you can give us?  &#x200B;  I'm sorry if I've posted this in the wrong place.  I'm scared and trying my best to learn what I can do  what I should do and what can be done to help my parents.

573,EmpoweredHealth,[NEWS] American women are punished and held back for having their periods,Across America  nearly 12 million women and girls aged 12 to 52 are living in poverty. This 40-year span is the average range of a U.S. female’s menstruation. If most of these females are struggling to afford food  how can they be expected to buy tampons?  Menstrual products are not SNAP eligible  meaning they are not covered by food stamps  yet they are one of the most requested items at homeless shelters. To put it in perspective: a 36-count box of tampons costs about $7. The average woman goes through approximately 240 tampons per year. That’s a set back of $48 annually and $1920 over her entire menstruation– even more if she has a heavier flow.  The American College of Obstetrics estimates two-thirds of low-income women don’t have enough money to buy menstrual products at least one time per year. It is also an impediment to education: a study by Always found that one in five girls have missed school due to a lack of period protection.  Financial status aside  we’re all getting penalized for having our periods. Products that count as a medical expense are exempt from sales tax  like band-aids  walkers  sunscreen– even Viagra gets a tax break in every state besides Illinois. Yet menstrual products are only currently tax-free in 15 states; five of those states don’t even have sales tax in general. Many period equity advocates have pressed on why tampons and sanitary napkins are taxed since menstruating is a biological function.  I'm a producer for Empowered Health  a podcast focused on navigating women's health  we just released an episode all about period poverty  menstrual equity  and the tampon tax.  We talk with Nadya Okamoto of PERIOD. The Menstrual Movement and Kate Sanetra-Butler of Dignity Matters  two leaders working to end period poverty  who break down why it should be a right to health for every woman to have access to menstrual products. Sanetra-Butler’s organization is on a mission to get menstrual products into all the schools  shelters  clinics  and whenever needed in Massachusetts  currently supporting over 2 500 women and girls every month. PERIOD. mobilizes college and high school students to advocate for period equity in over 400 chapters nationwide. Colorado Rep.

574,EmpoweredHealth,[NEWS] American women are punished and held back for having their periods,Across America  nearly 12 million women and girls aged 12 to 52 are living in poverty.

Menstrual products are not SNAP eligible  meaning they are not covered by food stamps  yet they are one of the most requested items at homeless shelters. To put it in perspective: a 36-count box of tampons costs about $7. The average woman goes through approximately 240 tampons per year. That’s a set back of $48 annually and $1920 over her entire menstruation– even more if she has a heavier flow.

I've heard ideas floating around that insurance should cover menstrual products; I've heard mention of state and federal govt services that would provide these items for free... But in reality  we have a long way to go before we get there. I think the most important and feasible thing at the moment is sparking the conversation and educating people about the cost of this and the national impact. Girls who miss school because of their periods have a higher likelihood of not graduating. Women have called off for work because of their menstruation - imagine the loss of productivity. Unfortunately  that's how we have to frame the conversation so people can get interested and make change.   The other issue is the corporations that manufacture these items. They are heavily marked up  and are an impediment for women who cannot afford it. I know some work places and schools now offer free feminine hygiene products in their bathrooms  but I'm sure it's not the norm (though I hope it will be one day).,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.19375,17300,

577,Passit2Madden,[News] Healthcare's biggest stories  week of June 11  2019 - Managed care's big investor week  return of the health insurance tax  is a $2.1 million drug list price ethical? VA gets privatized  and more.,"# Managed Care's big week  Over the past few weeks  the largest managed care players have provided us with insights into the healthcare industry from a payor's perspective. Anthem  UnitedHealth  Humana  CVS  and Cigna all had interesting things to say.   &#x200B;  **Here's what you need to know:**  **UnitedHealth** wants to grow **Optum** to $100 billion in revenue by 2028  but they're not planning on [**building any hospitals**](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/payer-issues/unitedhealth-ceo-optum-won-t-build-hospitals.html). The growth strategy banks on Medicare Advantage growth  increased local care delivery  expanding into areas of healthcare with increasing intensity of services (like ambulatory surgery centers)  and increasing medical efficacy.   &#x200B;  **Anthem** touted its investments in AI during the conference  giving mention to predictive analytics  adjusting for [**social determinants of health**](https://ir.antheminc.com/news-releases/news-release-details/new-anthem-public-policy-institute-report-outlines-key-0)  and health risk assessments with the ultimate goal of driving down costs. The payor also wants to continue its Medicaid joint ventures with the Blues and likewise continue the integration of its newly established PBM Ingenio Rx.  &#x200B;  In other Anthem news  the payor is making a push into behavioral and mental health with its recently announced [**acquisition of Beacon Health Options**](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190606005173/en/)  a behavioral health management organization.  Anthem  Inc. to Acquire Beacon Health Options  &#x200B;  **Humana**'s Chief Medical Officer made it clear that the payor's strategy [**revolves around the home**](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/payer-issues/cmo-dr-william-shrank-on-humana-s-physician-strategy-medicare-for-all-and-home-care-as-the-netflix-of-healthcare.html). He continued by saying that Humana differentiated itself from UnitedHealth and CVS/Aetna by focusing on the home  whereas UnitedHealth is focused on a primary care physician acquisition strategy  and CVS is honed in on retail settings.   &#x200B;  **CVS/Aetna**'s investor day was chocked full of growth details surrounding its [**new ""HealthHUB"" in-store plan**](https://cvshealth.com/newsroom/press-releases/cvs-health-outlines-strategy-accelerate-growth). I touched on the HealthHUB plan [**previously while covering the JP Morgan investor conference at the beginning of the year**](https://www.healthymuse.email/weekly-muse-1-11-2019/). Anyway  CVS is expanding the ""health and wellness"" store concept to [**1 500 locations by 2021**](https://www.cvshealth.com/thought-leadership/cvs-health-announces-significant-expansion-of-healthhub-to-deliver-a-differentiated-consumer-health-experience). Ambitious af.  &#x200B;  **Cigna** brushed off any challenges involved in the changing healthcare regulatory landscape  touting their ability to work through tough policy environments. The firm shrugged off any possible effect of drug rebate reform and reiterated its approach to partnering with physicians (rather than buying them) to separate themselves from the healthcare delivery system for the purpose of enhanced patient support.  &#x200B;  **Return of the** **~~Jedi~~** **health insurance tax.**  Several insurers were asked about the return of the health insurance tax  and how the tax might affect the industry in 2020 and beyond. As you could imagine  they [**responded with some distaste**](https://www.ahip.org/ahip-supports-bipartisan-legislation-to-eliminate-the-burdensome-health-insurance-tax/)  stating that the health insurance tax would cause instability in the insurance market and probably result in higher premiums.   Interestingly  some think that the health insurance tax wouldn't affect insurers on the ACA exchanges - meaning that they could simply raise the price of premiums to exactly counteract any taxation.   &#x200B;  **Stunting Medicare Advantage growth to Tyrion's level.**  On the other hand  insurers might not get away with that tactic in the rapidly growing Medicare Advantage market due to the current competitive nature of that exchange (insurers want the Baby Boomer Biz - duh). Instead of passing on the tax via higher premiums  insurers might opt to provide less coverage through these plans  or compete in other ways.   Either way  insurers definitely do not want to lose any MA enrollees  since MA is the major driver of their growth story on quarterly conference calls. In fact  the health insurance tax might deter would-be enrollees from even signing up for Medicare Advantage  instead opting for **traditional** Medicare.  &#x200B;  # Veterans Affairs shifts to private model  **VA gets privatized.**  Enough about managed care companies. Veterans are about to be [**given the green light**](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/05/us/politics/va-health-care-veterans.html) to receive care at any hospital - beyond just VA-designated hospitals. The policy appears to be a somewhat unprecedented move - according to the NY Times  the VA has about 9 million enrollees  which would mean that this shift would be the largest change in healthcare since the ACA.   Essentially  this move is more or less privatizing VA healthcare with the intention of ""greatly opening"" medical care to veterans.  &#x200B;  # Congress gets fed up with health data breaches  &#x200B;  **Whipped into shape.**  An EVER growing number of healthcare companies continue to get hacked. This time  though  [**Congress had some things to say to Quest and LabCorp**](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-05/growing-hack-of-health-care-data-attracts-scrutiny-of-congress)  who got in trouble from some reps after using a third party agency called American Medical Collection Agency.   Representatives thought that the companies were acting pretty lazy with the precious data by outsourcing. It's also worth noting that while the companies won't be fined or financially punished by the hack  the data breach is a credit-negative event.  &#x200B;  # Is a $2.1 million drug price ethical?  &#x200B;  **A price tag on life. Sort of.**  Novartis drew raised eyebrows over the weekend when it [**priced its spinal muscular atrophy treatment Zolgensma at $2.1 million**](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/may/25/21m-novartis-gene-therapy-to-become-worlds-most-expensive-drug). Yep  you read that right. But is that a good or bad thing? Is the price ethical when it's saving lives? Some of my (somewhat ignorant) thoughts are below. Interested to hear others' opinions as well.  &#x200B;  In this specific case  here's the perspective of Novartis: drugs in general are [**extremely costly**](https://www.policymed.com/2014/12/a-tough-road-cost-to-develop-one-new-drug-is-26-billion-approval-rate-for-drugs-entering-clinical-de.html) to research  develop  and bring to market. The disease that the drug treats  spinal muscular atrophy  is extremely rare. If the disease is NOT treated  then the infant may die and/or struggle long-term with expensive treatment and machinery for the rest of its life.   &#x200B;  But if the drug is effective - which it appears to be in most instances - it could save quite a bit of time  money  and healthcare utilization by stopping the disease in its tracks.  &#x200B;  In my mind  it seems as if Novartis more or less attempted to estimate the cost to the healthcare system of that patient WITHOUT the new drug  then priced their drug within - or  as they claim  well below - that range. Still  the distinct possibility exists that the drug might not work in all patients  and the final list price was $2.1 million  after all.   &#x200B;  It remains to be seen whether insurance covers any of that price  but Novartis is guaranteed to have a payment installation plan in lieu of insurance.  &#x200B;  Since Novartis developed the drug  the biotech firm gets ‘rewarded’ for taking on the high  high risk of developing a cure for SMA. If Novartis hadn’t found a cure for the disease  the company would have pumped billions of dollars into R&D and received…nothing. Which happens decently often.   &#x200B;  Despite these factors  many experts still consider the list price excessive. The final question I would ask on the ethics  though  is would you rather have the drug at an excessively steep price or no drug at all? It’s a tough one  huh…  Read some perspectives from parents and individuals who actually have  or have seen  the disease firsthand:  [**Is $2.1 million too much for a drug?

One doctor trip was over $100 and that didn't include all the bloodwork and additional appointments she needed to go to  or prescription painkillers.

Budget your health costs  utilize company FSAs for known costs.  Lobby your state reps to make tiered programs to help people in your situation. Some states have better insurance markets than others also.  Maybe move to one of those.  Also  technically there is no provision for Medicaid that says you are to include family members just because of marriage.  I believe most applications focus on Household size. i.e if you aren't living with your spouses your income does not count.   Have her address be a family member and say your both are separated.  Blame your state and our country for not having a tiered system that allows you to buy into Medicaid or Medicare,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.25,17307,

Medicaid is based on income not assets so it’s usually easier to lower your income.   That said  your deductible is insanely low  you’re close to qualifying for Medicaid and your plan may be better than Medicaid. So you’re options are better than many Americans.   I would try out the current plan for a year then lower income if needed  including asking for a pay cut and changing to an employer who pays more benefits but less cash. Then vote for any / all healthcare changes possible. People in other countries don’t face these choices  despite paying less than half what we do.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.07678571428571426,17308,

She wants to divorce me so that she can get on the state insurance program (AZ). I don't qualify for this because I make just over the income limit for 2 people. Our state health insurance allows you to see a doctor or specialist for free in many cases  and is even beginning to cover dental work. Obviously  neither of us want to get a divorce. I'm not even mad at her for this and if we don't find an immediate solution I am going to go through with it. Personally I think it's extremely sad that it's even come to this.

Alot of states use data that is reported by employers to verify income  so if you had income in the last quarter they would ask about that and you would provide proof of not working there anymore.  They probably won't ask though.  Same thing goes for foodstamps  however you have to have a face to face meeting with a worker for that. All of this is dependent on household income...so if you live with someone then their income could count on your case.  Cobra isn't something you have to purchase ahead of time.

I'm not very familiar with COBRA  but I believe it would be about $600/month to continue with the healthcare plan I have now. That's pretty steep.  I'm young and healthy  so I'd rather pay a low premium and risk a high deductible.  Can you qualify for Medicare if you're only temporarily unemployed?

It’s 18 months.  So they are losing their coverage  too  most likely.  You will be able to purchase a plan on the state or national (if your state is governed by a bunch of dicks) exchange.  Let me know if you have more questions.  You should ask your parents what they are doing  though  because if they are using COBRA and it’s over they’ll need to go on the exchange as well.  I don’t know if they can buy a policy you are included on because I don’t have children but you should run it by them as well.

You can only do this for 18 months.  Then you must go on the open market.  This rule was introduced prior to the implementation of the ACA because the only two or three other ways to get a policy when you got kicked off your employer’s was to go on your spouse’s (problematic for singles and gay people as there was no gay marriage)  qualify for Medicaid (and you could really only do that as an adult of any age in about half the states  I don’t have exact statistics but there were several places I considered moving when I had cancer and couldn’t work because I could get Medicaid)  go on the open market (and if you had ever been sick good luck cause health insurance companies could either gouge you or deny you and you had no protections against it). COBRA was some bullshit solution cause this was even happening to former Senators.  It’s almost outdated with the exchange up and running and the full implementation of the ACA.    If your father is still working and has had that same job for a number of years  and *especially with the job he has*  he ain’t on COBRA.

649,newbiecoach,[Question - Other] Suicidal 27 years old. OSTEOarthritis in spine  hips  elbows  knees  shoulders. Can future technology save me?,"Not asking for medical advice. Just telling my story and asking a general question about medical technology  hope mods wont remove the post  thanks.  Hi  I would appreciate any input regarding my situation. This is not a ""diagnose me"" question  and I understand it may be taken down. I asked here  since I assume there are a few medical proffesionals here.  Dont be afraid to give me ""bad"" honest answers - for example  ""science is nowhere near regenerating spinal joints etc""  My MAIN question is this - where do you guys see ""regenerative"" medicine in 20+ years? Especially regarding bone disorders - osteoartritis  spinal stenosis etc.  My story. Very physicaly active childhood  sports  weigtlifting etc.  Preexisting conditions/injuries  a - flat foot  b - no natural curvature in lower spine - flat back  c - hip inpingement from childhood - FAI  d - 3 metre fall on upper back  which started my pain story. 5 years ago  when I was 22  In short - a b c have played some part in my spinal/hip/knee osteoartritis. I played a lot of basketball/volleyball and my body just isnt built to absorb impact I guess. A b c my have caused my spine/knees/hips to degenerate faster than they should.  5 years ago fell on my upper back. Stopped lifting due to pain  started running/bodyweight training.  6 months later hips and elbows started to hurt. Did MRI for back/hips/knees - all show osteoarthritis in spine  hips  knee  elbow  right wrist and tendinopathy in my elbows/achilles/hamstring etc.  Stopped all activities. For last 4 years have been on/off physical therapy. It is HARD to motivate myself  because physical therapy makes by back hurt MORE after exercise.  Hips/knees hurt LESS after physical therapy - go figure.  Long story short - I am suicidal - hips/knees/elbows DONT bother me as much  its the f****** BACK. If I lay in bed all day it hurts less  then if I try to stay active/mobile.  Back pain has destroyed my libido  taken my job from me  relationships and my joy. Not to mention I have almost no close family... - my mother died young  an alcoholic  my father didnt raise me  but we are decent with communication  not friends  but I guess OK. My grandparents  who raised me  are nearing their death and they are the only ones keeping me alive right now.  I could never hurt them by taking my life before them  taking into account they have already lost their daughter - my mom.  My vertebrae havent fused yet and I dont have stenosis  but I guess they are very likely in the future.  My question is  - and this is the only thing that gives me hope - can I look forward to technology to save me from pain in future?

Dont stop looking for help and hoping for the future.  New advancements are always coming available.  There are many studies currently being done to develop techniques to regrow quality bone  including gene therapies. https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1741-7015-9-66  Unfortunately science is not there at the moment  but I do know that technology is rapidly involving.    A lot of resources are being poured into developing this technology.  You can see this advancement by looking at orthopedic advancements. Hip surgeries 30 years ago were not nearly as successful and had many complications  compared to now.  Knee replacements  spinal fusions and other options are always being improved.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.02148760330578512,17375,0.198

If you don’t think your physio will work long term  try to look for other movement specialists outside the field of physiotherapy such as a kinesiologist.

The help that I am writing about is not medical in nature.  &#x200B;  I suspect that fall that you had really did set things in motion.  I don't believe you ever full recovered from the fall.  It is my belief that your body is still sort of stuck in a damaged state and that the osteoarthritis is a symptom that has developed since the fall.  &#x200B;  Everything in the body is interrelated with other parts  so when you took the fall.  The imprint of the incident was felt throughout the body.  Without a full body approach to healing  I don't believe you will get better.  &#x200B;  As you fell on your upper back  most of the directly related imprint will have been left on your hamstrings.  They will most definitely need to be treated in conjunction with any treatment you get on your upper back.  This is a very simplified view of your situation.

Because we don’t pay that much over time in taxation.  You see  the amounts you’re being charged are bogus. They are made up by hospitals. They can do this because they are allowed so  get reimbursed by insurance companies anyways  and in an emergency you are in no position to go hospital shopping to see where you get the best deal on that bullet extraction or emergency ultrasound. So they charge whatever they can get their hands on.  I can only give you a first hand experience from my own country. Here there’s a number of state run insurance companies  as well as some private run ones (but those only offer a few extra out patient care facilities and better TVs in hospital rooms). The insurance companies determine every few years who is the cheapest provider on the market for a certain procedure or product that meets the standards of care. From then on  they will only reimburse that amount of money  bar there are strong arguments to make exemptions. So the pharmaceutical companies and hospitals either have to meet that set price  or don’t get the money back (that way competition is incentivized  but often hospitals will pay for certain special stuff themselves to use it as marketing). So  while an x ray and physical at an ER in the US might cost 3000$  the same here in austria would cost something like 200-300€.   Now  hospitals often need extra financial assistance by the government  but we’re still nowhere how mich that would be in the US. The fact that many people have to go bankrupt before they could ever pay off their medical bills actually means the US government has the step in frequently  making it so that even though patients are billed so highly  government spending on heath is still the highest per capita of he developed countries.  TLDR: taxation doesn’t cost as much as privately paid  not over time  not ever  IF DONE REMOTELY RIGHT!,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.16620634920634916,17397,
