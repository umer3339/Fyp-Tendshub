2183,BlueDarterz,[Question - Other] My Mother Needs a Liver Transplant  and She's Afraid the Cost Will Ruin Us,Hi  my name is Cullen  and I live in Maine and I'm 21. For 11 years my mother has been fighting Non-Hochkin's Lymphoma.  She's been through 8 rounds of chemo  since I began counting when I was 14  and 3 rounds of radiation.  We were recently told  in early May of this year  her cancer had gone into remission.  Yesterday morning  we got a call that has since made us all terrified for any number of reasons.  Mom was informed her Lymphoma has metastasized to her Liver.  We were informed she has two options: a liver transplant  or to risk getting plecebos in double blind clinical studies.  Neither of these are pleasant  and both are relatively expensive  the former exorbitantly so.  We were recently given 200k in grant money for Homesteading  building a farm/range essentially in Maine.  Our hopes were to purchase a farm house  and some land but now we're afraid to.  My aunt had her home levied 6 years ago to pay for a bypass surgery  and we're scared similar will happen should we purchase a home.  We're afraid they might demand payment the same day as the surgery  which while I think would be uncommon  I've had happen before.   From what my parents have told me  with all our insurance it only covers 40% of the cost  and looking online and seeing an approximation of 575 000$  for someone in college thats terrifying to think about.  My question for the people of r/healthcare is: can they take away our home?  If so  what else can they take from us?  Will they require us to pay the same day my mother has the surgery? What can we do to stop them?  How much is this surgery going to cost us?  Is there any advice you can give us?  &#x200B;  I'm sorry if I've posted this in the wrong place.  I'm scared and trying my best to learn what I can do  what I should do and what can be done to help my parents.  If there is a better place for the question please advise me where  as I will take it there.

The most likely path will be separating your mother from your father’s income so she can qualify for Medicaid on her own. The question will be how far she has to go to do that.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.29,17289,-0.438

I was pretty dejected for a while after that.  1. I wrote down what skillset I wanted to use in my daily work. Throughout my Ph.D I did mostly data analytics consulting  and wanted to switch to strategy development. In other words  move from the person in the field  to the person who decides what programs in the field get funded 2. I made a master list of potential employers  and ranked by interest. Your best shot at breaking into the USGOV/UN agency networks is straight out of school  so I ranked these highly. 3. For the top 5 institutions  I started looking at the company website job listings. Most of these never made it onto job aggregators. I also specifically checked the consulting portal  which is separate from the employment portal 4. I asked 4 of my advisors/colleagues if I could list them as references 5. I waited. I know the fiscal year ends in June for most large donors. You'll get a spate of last minute spending in May  and then a large number of listing in September/October as funding trickles down to NGOs and subs. Last October is when I started applying 6. I paid attention to my University job listserv. I was lucky to attend a namebrand school with a great network 7. I stayed in contact with past colleagues casually  so when I started looking  I could ask them to throw me any jobs they saw.

One of those organizations was a referral  the other two I got my foot in the door through a cold application. On all three  I was able to develop a reputation for high-quality work and was given follow-on work and expanded roles (and expanded salary). Most of the work started out in rudimentary data analysis  and I was able to shift towards strategy  writing papers  and implementation science as I became the subject matter expert on the dataset.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.062063492,19157,

What’s the problem you’re trying to solve?  2. Would the time  money  and resources be better spent on a different intervention that could save more lives/reduce morbidity?  For number 1  I assume you’re targeting gun accidents  which total about 500 people killed annually. A USA Today article I just saw put child accident deaths at about 80 in 2018. Training does nothing to prevent intentional deaths such as suicide and poverty violence.   For number 2  you have to estimate some costs. There are 132 853 K-12 schools in the US. You cant teach a whole school training at once  so you’d likely need on average 20 training modules per school (guessing)? A training class needs to last likely between 4-8 hours. I estimate cost of instructor salary at $25 per hour. Multiply those out and the cost of education is $266-531M a year.   Half a billion a year possibly to train all students.

Treating it as a toy leads to accidents  that’s about it. Nobody is committing mass shootings because they think a rifle is a toy.

One time from eating a slice of salmon. It varies every time. I’ll eat that meal again and I don’t have it. I’ll eat a huge meal and feel perfectly fine.

I  like many of you here  feel physical symptoms and pain that feel  and ostensibly  are  real  even if they’re psychosomatic or brought on by the anxiety itself. I’m committed to the idea that the real issue is the health anxiety  and not any one symptom. My question  though  is if any of you have tips on focusing on the anxiety as the issue and not fixating on symptoms?

The major thing that I did at first was research anxiety and panic disorders extensively. I read up on all of the symptoms of this disorder  a massive list. I then began to instead of focusing on the random ""symptoms"" of some far fetched condition  focusing on them as anxiety symptoms. The tingling in my hands and feet no longer meant Multiple Sclerosis/Diabetes. The random speech errors and typing errors no longer meant brain tumor or other neurological condition. I had to force myself recognize that all I am feeling is anxiety.  Its like reteaching yourself how to ride a bike  there was a time when you never worried about your health (more than likely). You have to constantly reassure yourself that you are fine despite never feeling fine.  Also make sure that you are sleeping on time. I find that I am most anxious when I go to bed after 1 AM or if I do not get enough sleep. Prioritize 8 hours a night and switch back to a sleep schedule in which you go to bed early and wake up early.  Another good tip is a healthy diet. Try to avoid fast food and prepackaged meals. We are human  and it is OK to go and get fast food occasionally  I try not to more than 2 or 3 times a week (as a 21 year old). Magnesium Citrate  Vitamin D3 (2000u) and a daily multivitamin can also make you have more energy. The Magnesium helps regulate brain traffic (lowering general daily anxiety) and also helps with muscle pains and general aches.  Get into the habit of working out. At least 3 times a week. Whether it be running  weight training  or just a nice 15 minute walk  it helps immensely.  Finally  reading helps a lot.

I feel like so many of us worry  ""am I sick? What should i do?"" And the reality of it is  we ARE sick. We have anxiety. And instead of treating our real condition  we are distracted by chasing solutions to imaginary diseases. Getting down to the root  to the anxiety  addresses all of our psychosomatic symptoms at once  so we have less aches and pains to catastrophize over.  I would first set an appointment with a mental health professional who can give you an objective third-party opinion of your situation  as well as tools and techniques to help differentiate anxiety symptoms from real symptoms. Improving your mental health will simultaneously improve all of the symptoms that manifest as a result of anxiety  so you wont feel as sick physically. It is truly a ""many birds with one stone"" approach.   Also take steps to improve your physical and mental health on your own. Physical activity has innumerable benefits for all aspects of your health  and it can help you develop more trust in your body to function properly. Start slow and be consistent  and feeling/seeing the results will be a big boon to your progress. You have a lot of options to choose from: weight training  running  swimming  biking  yoga  hiking  etc. Eat a healthy well-balanced diet. Find hobbies that you enjoy and that will keep you grounded and distracted when anxiety rears its ugly head (reading  journaling  video games  crafting  painting  playing an instrument  learning a skill or language  etc).

Before I started  I applied directly to PhD programs at schools that did not require a master's degree  but I wasn't accepted. I had prior graduate level education  high gpa/gre  work experience  teaching experience  but not a lot of public health experience. Not saying it's impossible to be admitted without a master's  just that it's going to hard and you're probably going to want letters of recommendation from some heavy weight professors and/or be in contact with professors from the school first. When it comes to PhD programs  it's often as much about who you know (or who your advisor knows) as it is your personal attributes. Also  try to get on a couple of papers in your current labs  if possible. You don't have to be first author  but a publication record is important.   Next  if it's the hard sciences that you like  which is what it seems like from your two current lab roles  you will be pretty far removed from chem/biochem/biology in most public health fields. I was disappointed with the lack of biological training in my program. Most public health fields are more about qualitative and quantitative analysis of data than lab work. Just know what you're getting into and what kind of research you like.   Also  be realistic about the kind of public health research that gets funded. The reality is that a lot of the ""big"" studies are conducted by the CDC or other government organizations.  If I could do it all again (starting straight out of college)  I would do an MD/MPH program. MDs tend to get better funding from research organizations  and you can have more one-on-one interaction with research participants. Of course  it depends on your interests and if you have any interest in working with research participants in a medical setting. Plus  you don't need a master's to get into medical school  which solves your problem with your family.",,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.090833333,19003,

If you have plans on becoming a professor  you’ll have to do a lot of research and work on getting some of your research published. My son  who has an MPH had a research study published in a reputable journal during his undergrad  and I believe that helped him get into all the public health schools for which he applied. He then had his capstone project published as well at the end of his MPH. So yes  definitely research  but you have to do more than just research something on your own.

You learn a lot of it on the floor as a bedside nurse. Your clinical experience is more valuable in the IT world. That knowledge really expands the IT world.  As far as any summer jobs  I'm a little unsure  depends on the hospital if they offer any Implementation SuperUsers. Hell  even a Helpdesk job at a Hospital would give you a leg up on any competition.  My organization is currently going through a ""realignment"" so we currently are doing ""lateral"" movements. For me  opportunities come and go. If you have a chance to assist in any project  take initiative. Be proactive. For example  if there are any opportunities to become a trainer or superuser. Take that opportunity to thoroughly know the EHR. Ask to assist in Go-Lives  this gets your feet wet in many aspects of HIT.   Becoming an RN really allows that communication line open between IT and Medical Professionals. It allows you to really understand their workflow. All and all  RNs are a major player. They understand workflow which is an ""Informaticist"" Since you understand that  you can move laterally to an analyst  then manager  or project manager therefore the foundation of understanding workflow really can move mountains in this world.

",,No video,3/7/2019 9:08,17,5,3,zytz,the best nurse informaticists i've worked with are great because they've spent some amount of time actually practicing as a nurse  and can be thought of as experts in their area.  having actually spent time in the ED/OR/ICU etc. they have firsthand experience being in those environment as well as experience with the challenges those areas face.  As someone with an academic background in Informatics I have the capacity to approach and conceptually understand any sort of problem I'm presented with in the context of the specific systems I support  but a subject matter expert in an area will have the capacity to understand these issues functionally  and provide sometimes invaluable input on why certain conceptually viable  IT solutions are not viable functionally.  Having additional informatics education is never going to be a bad thing in my opinion  however I don't feel it will be more valuable than firsthand experience.  Transition from clinical care to HIT is a common path into the field.  Informatics roles typically aren't heavily involved in development or technical support of HIT systems in my experience  but lots of former clinicians make their way into analyst roles as well  and do have jobs that are more technical in nature.  That said  generally speaking  analyst jobs aren't so technical that you should consider additional education exclusively for that role  if that's the sort of work you're interested in.  Again  it certainly won't hinder you  but I've spent plenty of time with great analysts that have 2 year nursing degrees from years ago as their only education  so its certainly not a requirement.  As far as moving up the corporate ladder  those paths are available to you as well  but exactly what your limit is with your current education is somewhat organization dependent.  For example at my org I anticipate i'll be capped at low or mid-level management or project management without further education (4 year BS  Informatics)  but a previous hospital I worked for employed a CIO with a 2-year computer science degree  so mileage certainly can vary.  As far as salaries I've only personally worked in analyst roles in a hospital so if you're interested in that path PM me- additionally my sister is a relatively new nurse and I have some insight on how she's been doing financially as well,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.089562876,18054,

The best advise I can give is to keep this specialty in the back of your mind for your first 4-5 years as a bedside nurse. As others have stated  what separates a nurse in HIT from an analyst is their understanding of workflows and the needs of the ""in the trenches"" providers. You can only get that through experience at the bedside. Further  most nursing informaticists draw heavily from their bedside area of expertise and you'll be the go-to for that specialty (although you'll eventually branch out and learn nursing specialties that are outside of your comfort zone). For me as a cardiac nurse  it was pediatric oncology. I got tapped for a project and in order to be effective at understanding their needs and how to speak to them I needed to do a deep dive and learn how to be an oncology nurse first.    So while you're waiting to transition into informatics  remember to first take excellent care of your patients. Once you're comfortable managing your time and delivering good care as a new grad (about a year in)  then start trying to be the ""go-to"" for tech roll-outs on your unit and the hospital. Become a ""super user"" and network with the informaticists. We often keep an eye out for who would be a good addition to the team  and we only know that from knowing you.   Focus on being a good nurse and a positive team member and you'll be well positioned to excel in HIT. Oh  and skip the health informatics degree. I've yet to see that paper ever help anyone get a job in HIT that wasn't already going to. And conversely I've seen a number of people with it passed over for positions because they didn't have enough practical real-world experience. The adage is  you can teach a nurse to be an IT analyst  but you can't teach an IT analyst how to be a nurse.   Salary-wise  I'm in the Chicagoland area at one of the bigger organizations with 10 years under my belt (6 in HIT) and I'm at $96k.   As a nurse you can absolutely ""climb the corporate ladder"" but in my experience unless you're someone who needs to chase a title for a sense of personal pride  it's not worth it. This may not be everywhere  but at my org once you flip into the management track typically you lose the ""clinical"" prefix to your position and therefore aren't compensated in a way that reflects your license. Many of our clinical analysts (especially the senior clinical analysts) are paid more than our managers. That is of course until you get to the Director or VP level  otherwise your salary doesn't tend to pace well compared to the stress and workload. But hey  to each their own. You can also make a shitload of money as a consultant  but there are a number of cons to that as well (constant travel  unpredictability  and the market seems a little over-saturated now since there aren't as many system-wide implementations now that meaningful use has been in place for a decade now).  Summer jobs? I like the help-desk idea that someone suggested  but I'd focus on something clinical like an internship or working part-time as a CNA for a hospital system you'd like to work at. Even better if you can figure out the type of unit you'd like to start your career on (and leverage the experience from it in your informatics career). Life is all about networking  when you graduate there's literally tens of thousands of new nurses graduating with you in your state. If you've got an in because you've proven yourself to be a good member of the team  you're almost guaranteed a job.

I see myself working the bedside at least for a couple of years after graduating (dec of this year). As a nursing student  I have worked with EPIC for about 2 years now  and have been interested in how to optimize its utility.   &#x200B;  I would like a career that explores how to improve the jobs of the nurses at the bedside  and am hoping that Health IT will play a role in this aspect. I would like to learn how to analyze data in a system to see what might be working on a floor  and what might not be working so hot. However  I don't have any technological background. I don't really know much about IT  but I am eager to explore all of my options as a nurse.   &#x200B;  Of course  money plays a factor in the career I want. As a neonatal nurse practitioner  which I have mild interest in  I could clear 100K upon graduating  and probably max out at 120. However  it will take as little as 4 years after graduating to even break into that position when considering the graduate degree and required experience to get into a program.   &#x200B;  On the flip side  I've talked to nurses that have transitioned right from bedside nursing to a health IT position without any degree beyond a BSN. Of course  they are now working towards degrees in business administration or Masters in Health IT  but it wasn't required for the position. Is the compensation similar in IT? Is it more? Is it less? If I am ambitious  can I take on more roles and move up in mgmt positions? This is such a new position it seems  that I can not find much relevant information. ,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.202697084,18059,

Sure  the decrease of nutrients is not ideal but let's put this into perspective.   A 5.1% drop in iron sounds spooky. Let's take whole wheat for example. 100 g of wheat contains ~3.18 mg of iron  with the 5.1% drop you are now getting 0.16 mgs less. It's a negligible amount  and is unlikely to have any measurable impact on your health. Additionally  iron from plant sources isn't absorbed as efficiently as iron from animal sources  so a well balanced diet will easily make up for this loss.   They mention protein as well  plant protein is already not an ideal source of protein but let's take soy as an example (one of the very few complete plant protein sources). A serving contains ~8g of protein  3% decrease would be a 0.24g difference which is negligible in the grand scheme of your daily intake.

We have Medicaid and Medicare. You have to qualify with either income  age or disability. Otherwise you HAVE to pay for insurance or go without and heaven forbid you get sick or have a medical emergency. Healthcare is expensive and if I understand correctly it doesn’t cross state lines. The pricing is not regulated at any level other than each hospital  meaning each hospital has its own price/charge method. Medicare and Medicaid have rules for payment and it’s complex. So complex you need analysts to figure out the rules to extract the data to give to the government. Also  they don’t pay well and can deny payment based on their rules/regulations. That’s just high level. So many go without insurance due to cost. Also  when you have insurance on top of your premiums you may have deductibles  out of pocket  etc. it’s all based on payment.

This idea of ""free market"" is so American  but most don't understand how the concept does not work in healthcare. Insurers do NOT want to compete for sick people.

IMO there is not a GOOD reason why both cannot exist alongside each other.   Medicare for all sounds great on a surface level only. Once you actually examine the issue in any depth whatsoever it becomes really evident that it’s a very complicated issue.   For example  studies regarding health outcomes based on public vs private insurance have yielded mixed results. Methodologies differ and there isn’t really consensus on correct methodology  so from a quality perspective either conservative or liberal rhetoric could be correct.   From a reimbursement perspective it matters a lot though  and I suspect on a large enough scale reimbursement would have a negative effect on quality as well. Currently in America the government options reimburse at something like 30% the rate of private insurers on average.  When hospital executives recently responded to question regarding their ability to continue to operate if all of their patients paid at Medicare rates  it’s not at all hyperbole when they say they’d have to shut down.   A lot of folks on the liberal side of the aisle might believe hospital administrators are simply too used to their cushy budgets  and in some cases that’s absolutely true. There’s tons of opportunity for fraud or mismanagement of funds in the current system. However there’s also the cases of critical access hospitals constantly trimming costs just to keep the lights on. These hospitals are rural  and are essentially healthcare outposts  providing limited care in areas that would otherwise be ‘healthcare deserts’ for lack of a better term.  Recently a lot of these hospital have ‘partnered with’ aka been sold to larger health systems that can afford to operate these locations at a loss because they’re unable to operate any longer on their own.  These locations have payor bases made up almost entirely of Medicare patients  and it’s not particularly surprising to anyone that they barely subsist.   Conversely  folks on the conservative side of the aisle worry about the expense of all the new patients receiving care on the governments dime  and in some respects they’re right to worry. One thing that government insurance indisputably excels at is providing access to care  which is a super important thing  and in my opinion was one of the best achievements of Obamacare. Suddenly you have a lot more people visiting PCPs that were not doing so previously  and those PCPs are now probably experiencing a poorer level of reimbursement on average because as we previously stated  Medicare simply doesn’t reimburse at the level of private insurers.   On the other hand  a significant portion of those people that are now showing up at the PCP were probably showing up at the Emergency Room previously  when shit was really bad for them. Especially in urban areas  folks without coverage at all commonly utilize hospital emergency rooms as their de facto PCP because they have nowehere else to turn. ED visits are exponentially more expensive than PCP visits  and don’t really do anything to address needs beyond the immediate reason for the visit. Emergency Departments frequently operate deeply in the negative in urban areas as a result. Medicare for all probably does quite a lot to relieve the expense of currently uninsured patients that currently show up  receive care  and then never pay  because they simply can’t. This expense is probably dicking over PCPs by shifting costs onto them  which sucks and is a problem that needs to be solved in any Medicare for all solution.   One huge opportunity for cost improvement that doesn’t get talked about enough is requiring public and private insurance to play by the same rules when it comes to billing. Medicare is pretty notorious for constantly changing their requirements for certain reimbursements to be paid. Failure to provide documentation of meeting these requirements in precisely the right way can result in the entire reimbursement for a visit to be denied. Not so bad for an office visit for example  but if you had a 4 night hospital stay that’s a lot of money for the hospital to get shafted on. This has had the effect of hospital hiring on entire departments specifically to manager and monitor documentation requirements are being met in precisely the correct way  and working with care teams to adjust documentation when required in order to get paid by Medicare. You would these these documentation requirements would be really important things for ensuring good patient outcomes  and sometimes they are. Many times though they’re almost entirely beauracratic in nature; simply boxes to be checked off by the care team where failure to do so has no impact on the patient but major impacts on reimbursement.  Furthermore  consider that private insurers frequently do not follow Medicare requirements for reimbursement  but have their own sets of rules. This means potentially new sets of rules for your paperwork for every payor your hospital is contracted with. The effect is that hospitals now dedicate a very significant portion of staff expenditure to PAPERWORK  when it should be spent on staff that are involved with patient care. In fact this overhead has grown SO MUCH that there’s a sub industry of business that are contracted by hospitals to manage their billing  claims  and reimbursements  and hospital and physician billing are separate services to boot.  So much cost has been introduced by these practices and in many cases it has not resulted in any tangible benefits to patients.   Developing a unified set of billing rules that all payors  public or private  agree and adhere to would greatly cut down on billing complexity and help hospitals begin reducing expenditures on administrative overhead. Furthermore  if universal codified billing rules exist  this means you can eliminate huge amounts of positions dedicated to the mire ph hospital billing by automating these processes in EMR systems. This cannot be done today due to the vast number of differences that exist between payors  and state and federal government rules. The technology exists now.   On the other hand  automating hospital billing with computer systems means a significant loss of jobs. I’ve read somewhere that estimates over a million jobs exist due to complexities in medical billing practices in the United States  and while it would be great for everyone to reduce that overhead  it would also result in a large and sudden unemployment of a significant number of people that work in that niche today.   Pharmaceuticals are sort of tied into our shitty insurance system   and it’s impossibly complicated  but I’ll just say that personally big pharma are both criminals and cartels  and even if conservative politicians are correct on the need to preserve their current practices for economic reasons  the pharma industry is full of crooks  and I’ve for relatively little sympathy for anyone employed there  and they need to be regulated to the very edge of bankruptcy or until they get the message to stop fucking anyone around. Big telecom is getting antitrust attention currently  but big pharma probably deserves it much more.   There’s other topics but honestly I’m pretty spent. In general I’d say any plan to immediately switch everyone to a public option is doomed to fail. A public/private combo is necessary  at least in the short term  and the government needs to address its ability to be competitive with other large payors unless we want to see a large decline in services in quality.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.058960753,17059,

Being able to buy additional private coverage on top of a mandatory universal system (like in your country  or the UK) isnt the same as having an optional public plan that you could choose whether or not to participate in. But youre totally right  talking about “abolishing private insurance” is a confusing and bad way to frame that difference.  As an aside  we have pretty much the situation you described in our Medicare program... you have a base level of coverage through medicare and can choose to pay an extra premium to purchase additional coverage through the private health insurance companies  this is called “Medicare Advantage” or “Part C”. Its becoming very popular and more and more old people choose to do private MA over the public version every year. Some of the private plans are so efficient (mainly through HMOs which limit you to one hospital system for non-emergency care) that they dont even charge a premium  so you can choose a private plan without paying any extra.

As far as the feasibility of providers operating in a public system goes  i was surpised myself to learn that in Australia  most private patients with complex needs end up getting shifted into a public hospital bed sooner or later. How could this be?  Because the public hospitals are where all the action is at. They have the best facilities  equipment and economies of scale. most importantly it's where all the best surgeons are at.  The private system depends on people signing and paying up voluntarily and it simply can't compete with a generously funded universal healthcare system.  The government provides standard rebates for all services  but it allows for the scope of a free market as well. The rebates are called Medicare listed items. Doctors are free to charge what they want. They can choose to take just the Medicare rebate  or choose to charge more than that and leave patients with out of pocket costs. You can guess what happens. It's most obvious in general practice. We have what are knows as ""bulk billers"". These are clinics which just take the Medicare rebate and charge nothing more. The patient pays zero and there's no extra costs. Then there are clinics which charge excess fees for whatever reason. Maybe they're open at 11PM on Sunday night. Maybe they're in a rich  fancy suburb. Maybe they have specialist services on offer. But you can guess what happens. Competition is tough for these guys. Their service had better be really good otherwise people will just stick with the bulk-billing GP where you don't have to pay a cent.",,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.214297386,17066,
1961,genialerarchitekt,[Discussion] Single Payer vs Private Health Care,As an Australian interested in the debate in the US over healthcare I'm confused about something. In the papers when I read about the debate over healthcare it's always presented as single payer vs private cover  ie an either/or situation.   But in Australia we have both: on the one hand we have Medicare which is universal coverage for all and everyone pays the Medicare levy which is 2% of their income.  However everyone also has the option of taking out private health cover on top of that if they want it. You even get a 30% rebate on your premiums from the government for doing so  because it's said to take some pressure off the public system.   (To be clear the public system is in fact excellent  and there are no crazy long queues to get urgent healthcare or substandard hospital rooms. The last time I was in a public hospital in 2018  I got my own room with colour TV  air conditioning and a bathroom. They are all moving to this model because it reduces the risk of infections spreading ie when patients are isolated. all the best surgeons work in the public sector because it's so big and well-funded. so when you need complex surgery you are usually shifted to a public hospital anyway if you are a private patient.)  So why is it always either/or in the American media?

I still don't really understand why people are talking about ""abolishing"" private health cover. Could you explain it?  Is your Medicare program the same though? I just mean it seems the one big difference between yours & ours is that ours is universal - whether you're homeless sleeping on the street or a  billionaire you are are covered - whereas yours seems to be just for a certain subset of the population and if you don't meet the criteria then bad luck.

The other 0.5% is to fund the national disability insurance scheme  which covers you for things like equipment & care plan costs in case you develop a disability.

I guess my point is that young people starting out often on lower incomes and healthy do get a break to some extent. And everyone understands that even though you start off young  we all get old and will likely need health care in the future  which your Medicare levy helps to fund.

From standpoint of pure business operations  private is doing it better than public by a long way currently.

Definitely scary to think about nationalization of healthcare  but if that were to happen immediately I can only imagine that costing several trillions of dollars to acquire the facilities  over a million jobs lost in the medical insurance and billing industries  an immediate scramble by currently uncovered patients to sign up with PCPs and probably a significant increase in wait times to be seen. There would be a shortage care team staff  schedulers  and actual physical space for folks that need to be treated that would desire for immediate treatment. I would imagine burnout only becomes more of a problem for care team members; we’re currently understaffed at a national level for both nurses and physicians and suddenly increasing the population of covered patients would certainly put a strain on our system.  Not sure how pharma plays into this  but our government would certainly hold a negotiation advantage orders of magnitude better than anyone has today so I imagine pharmaceutical costs and medical supply costs to hospitals would drop. I suspect our transplant wait lists would rise by a notable amount. In the slightly longer term I suspect a great deal of administrative staff would lose their jobs. Government run hospitals means it would be more efficient to consolidate hospital IT systems for example  to unified platforms across all locations. Whichever vendors were selected for lab systems  EMR systems  billing solutions  imaging solutions  etc would become effective monopolies in the US  and this might even have the effect of hurting competition globally. So you’d have this secondary wave of job losses and likely business closures  for all vendors that find themselves losing the lottery to provider various administrative software or services to the government. From an IT systems perspective alone we have several vendors that are generating several billions of dollars annually.  I suppose the same becomes true for manufacturers of medical supplies or equipment that are small or highly specialized. Any of these businesses that fail to win government contracts are likely going out of business  and taking lots of jobs with them.  Similar for the pharma industry even. Manufacturing employees are probably safeish  but the scores of pharmaceutical marketing specialists and sale people probably all get canned (though admittedly I have far less sympathy for them).   I’m sure there are loads of issues I’ve failed to even recognize here  but hopefully that illustrates some of the problems that would be created by an immediate changeover to a nationalized model. Over time I suspect things stabilize  but even solely from a job loss perspective this seems like a losing proposition  IMO.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.082903727,17081,

If you thought you might want to stay  you might consider going to a larger organization that can pile less work on you and let you focus more - it comes with its own set of challenges and bureaucracy for sure  but the org I'm with is big enough that we have teams that aren't support/have no on call (good because I would die)  most people don't have to run meetings  etc.  Our leaders are great and caring and would absolutely want to know that you are miserable  and if your manager knows how stressed you are and isn't being helpful that's on them.    Anyway  that said  as an Epic analyst you are super resourceful  you've got customer support experience  you've obviously learned a ton of different systems  you've probably had to deal with making big picture solutions  you've run a department meeting... lots of transferrable skills here.  And selfishly  I hope you stay in HIT  because we need you  and there are LOADS of different jobs here.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.183333333,17448,

To be honest  I'm not sure if it is either nature of the job vs specific organization (culture/intensity of new position). I think it's a combination of the people on my team  getting days off denied since so many projects are happening  and a few other things that were promised that I didn't get/things that were added later on that were never brought up. You're 100% correct  I receive a message from a recruiter once every two weeks about an open position. Epic is expanding and I think it will essentially be everywhere in the next 5-7 years.   &#x200B;  My on-call rotation isn't terrible. We have 9 people in the rotation including myself. I'll get one month where I am on for 7 days and other months where I'm not on at all. Sometimes I get forced into switching with people or taking it off their plate which isn't fun. That sounds awful having half your team quit. Our help desk always comes to us first for problems (most of the time it's not even for my team). I'm hoping my team can establish workarounds  it's just difficult since I am only certified in Cadence and my team is both Cadence and ADT (Grand Central) so I receive calls for both applications.

Americans prefer markets that self regulate but that only works when customers have the power of choice. And healthcare is devoid of customer choice so self regulation is impossible. So the only choice left to us is at the ballot box.   But what idea can win there? A majority of Americans won’t vote for power they think they already have or others should work for.

That seems to be the argument you are loosely making here  but I may be wrong. What perplexes me about this is that while medical care is indeed a service and a good provided by a third party  it is something that third party chose to practice. Because they chose to practice it  they may also leave at any time if they are unsatisfied with the duties encompassed in the job description. Declaring healthcare a human right does not somehow infringe upon the individual rights of healthcare professionals because no one is demanding that they practice medicine  nor is anyone demanding that they practice it for free.  We could also apply this argument to K-12 public education in the United States. Education is also a service and a good provided by a third party (i.e. teachers). Yet at some point in history we as a society decided that K-12 education is something everyone should have the opportunity to pursue because it is valuable to our social and economic wellbeing. Like healthcare professionals  teachers and educational administrators have chosen their profession and are monetarily compensated for their labor. The logic you seem to be applying to healthcare would suggest that this is theft and slavery  and that we should abolish public education and solely leave it to the free market. Therefore  if you as a parent can't afford to send your child to a private school  too bad. That's the free market at work and sometimes it leaves people behind. I think most of us (liberals and conservatives alike) would find this egregiously unjust  and yet this is the exact argument being used to classify healthcare as a commodity. Either extend this argument to other facets of society that function similarly  or abandon it. I don't see how you can argue for both without severely undercutting the other.  We can clearly see that the presence of K-12 public education hasn't led to the abolition of private schools -- they are still alive and well. As such  the presence of a universal basic healthcare system doesn't necessarily have to imply the annihilation of private insurance companies. There are plenty of developed nations that offer both  like the UK. In the UK everyone is covered by a public system but people can pay extra for insurance that gives them access to private doctors. I'm not sure why this is such a radical concept to some Americans. Maybe it's because this is all we've ever known -- I'm not sure. Either way  the economy won't flourish if people are too sick to contribute to it. And if the United States continues on the path it's on  this won't be an untenable consequence.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.049271062,16994,

In fact most socialized medical systems offer supplemental private insurance because they are situated in nations with capitalist economies. So you would have the freedom to seek out care you see fit for your Congestive Heart Failure or Chronic Renal Disease.

I’m thinking through those because I really don’t know much about the legal system compared to the medical system.  You know how on TV they always say “if you cannot afford an attorney  one will be appointed to you by somebody”...etc.   I wonder if how people would feel if they heard- “You have appendicitis. You have the right to a surgeon. If you cannot afford a surgeon  one will be appointed to you by the government.”  Now there’s a million questions about if that person is getting the same health care that a private pay person who can choose their surgeon gets. Take it from a surgeon  not all skill levels are the same...  I think the hard thing in medicine is the unbelievable cost of the top-of-the-line product.  That’s the thing that seems to be preventing unrestricted health care for all. Take it from me- it isn’t the doctors getting all the money!

I’m glad to hear that I’m not the only one who ever came up with this idea- that at least means it’s not completely crazy  I think.  I have some responses to what you wrote.  “Declaring healthcare a human right does not somehow infringe upon the individual rights of healthcare professionals because no one is demanding that they practice medicine  nor is anyone demanding that they practice it for free.” I think this answer is just begging the question. We are discussing whether someone is ever entitled to someone else’s labor and using healthcare as an example.  You seem to be saying that because a person voluntarily entered the field of medicine that they must accept another person’s right to their labor  or else they can leave and go do something else.  That argument just assumes the thing you are trying to prove- whether or not it is ok for people to claim a right to someone else’s labor.   I think to prove the correctness of that idea  you need to go in another direction. Another thing- even if your proposition wasn’t just begging the question  wouldn’t you be also (maybe involuntarily) saying that the performance of any job leaves one exposed to a public claim on that work whenever society feels that the work is sufficiently necessary to the public at large?  Maybe you’re not saying this  but I wonder on what grounds you could argue against such a claim.  For example  what if we as a society decided that iPhones are necessary for everyone to fully function as a citizen and have a reasonable quality of life?  We claim that “iPhones are a human right”. Your argument would then say that “No one is forcing Apple to make iPhones. They are free to make any product they like” while still demanding that as long as Apple makes iPhones  they should provide them to everyone since we decided that we “have a right” to them.  Would you support demanding that from Apple in that circumstance?     I realize you specifically said that no one is demanding that doctors practice for free  which actually leads to my next issue I wanted to cover. “public K-12 schools versus private” First  do you want a health care system that performs as well as the American public education system?  I am a product of that system and I don’t think it’s all bad  but a quick look at American ranking in education worldwide should temper the desire to handicap our health care system more than it already is.   The real issue is the cost.  I’m fine with the idea of a universal public option for health care (which kind of exists already thanks to EMTALA)  but the hard truth is that if costs of drugs and treatments don’t change  providing a maximal level of care to every person in America will bankrupt the whole system.  This isn’t even close to an issue about doctor reimbursement  which constantly goes down.  Two years ago one of the most common procedures that I do took a 40% hit in reimbursement.  Forty percent.  One year we got $10 for the procedure  the next we got $6 (figuratively speaking).  Try running your business with those kind of hits coming every few years.  If you want a public system that doesn’t bankrupt the country  then at least one of two things can happen.  Either we can decrease the cost of the drugs  fees  tests  etc.  or we can refrain from offering all treatments to all people.  The latter is horrendous.  “I’m sorry Mr. Jones  but the public health plan doesn’t cover dialysis for people over 65.  Your wife has a few days to live until she dies of kidney failure.” Ugh. Hopefully if this is the plan chosen then an administrator will be asked to have those conversations instead of the doctors.  The second option- decreasing the cost of all the parts of the healthcare system is at least more ethical  I think.  It does mean asking private companies to decrease their profits “just because”.  Given the obscene profits of the pharmaceutical companies that might seem more palatable.  But what about this- what if the pharma companies are told to decrease their prices and they have already done all they can to streamline the production of a drug and can’t sell it for less and still be profitable?  Do we demand that they continue to make it at a loss?  That sounds like a terrible idea- pretty sure that kind of thinking is how Venezuela got to where it is now.  If I was the company and I couldn’t make a profit on a thing  then my next move would be to stop making that thing.  So now maybe instead of merely being expensive  the drug in question is just unavailable.  Not sure that is much of a solution.  That would be the natural consequence of declaring the right to a person’s voluntary labor though- they may just quit volunteering.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.068229224,17010,

When the state gives the right  the state also is responsible for making sure that right is protected. our 'right to liberty' would mean nothing if the state didn't maintain a military to prevent invasion and protect the freedom. Our right to life would mean nothing if the state was not able to protect the sanctity of that life by making sure the police force exists. I don't understand how that is different from healthcare then. In fact  in my opinion  healthcare ties in directly to right to life.  &#x200B;  Right to fair trial does not mean that the defendant is allowed to choose the most expensive lawyer and bill them for hours of work at exhorbitant fees. The right to fair trial means that if the defendant is unable to pay for a lawyer  the state pays for one and this is usually taken care of through an office of public defendants. Why then can't we separate public and private healthcare. A reasonable healthcare should be available to all through public hospitals. Should the rich find it lacking in comfort or wish for a treatment that falls outside of the normal paradigm of care  they can choose to get private insurance and go to private hospitals. This is how most countries do it and i don't think any healthcare professionals in any of those countries have complained that they are being enslaved by being forced to provide their services. They are paid for those services as professionals usually are.   &#x200B;  There are established protocals on how a heart failure patient will be managed.

If the US had a national health system  more people would be able to seek out healthcare services. We charge waaaay too much over here! The physicians I know who were trained in the UK had similar training to their US counterparts still make a comfortable living. It’s not like they are giving away their services for free  they get paid through taxes from the NHS.   Imagine being an employed tax paying American citizen  whose job doesn’t provide health insurance. You make too much for Medicaid  but the market place plans are too expensive.  Those people have come into my urgent care and end up with $150 bill for sinusitis  plus cost of prescription at pharmacy. The same visit for me (with insurance) is $20 copay- 87% less than the out of pocket cost Hopefully they don’t end up needing that fancy aortic balloon!  So to answer your questions: yes  I think tax paying American citizens receiving healthcare in America have an absolute right to receive all of those healthcare services you mentioned. Health care services are considered expensive because the producers/people determine price are getting greedy trying to make a profit. I doubt the aortic balloon costs anywhere near $50k to produce.

And I think that when most people say “healthcare is a right” their intentions are to establish a political mandate that would fulfill that  as opposed to an argument regarding what rights are and aren’t. I personally think if the discussion primarily becomes an examination of natural rights then the argument is not addressed in terms of what is actually being promoted by the left (namely a policy initiative  not a philosophical doctrine). So I may not be the best person to address some of your questions  but I will give you my thoughts nonetheless.  &#x200B;  I don’t think your iPhone example is a strong enough parallel to healthcare (unlike the relationship between healthcare and public K-12 education). Apple products are goods that certainly make life easier (in some cases) but they don’t hold any claim over one’s life. That’s why we would never (and have not) declared them a “human right.” I don’t think you can just pick random goods out of a hat and attempt to compare them to healthcare or education when they don’t function similarly at all. Most of the time when I see people do this they seem to be asking “if this becomes a right then what else is next” without considering the stark differences between what we are calling a “right” and what they are proposing we would call a “right” in the future. It just ends up sounding silly. And while I do get that the quality of public K-12 education in this country is severely lacking (which can be attributed to a lack of funding)  it’s frightening to imagine how much worse off we’d be if we left it exclusively to the free market. The median household income in 2016 was $59 039. In my neighborhood there is a private boarding school that costs $43 390 a year in tuition. Do you realize the percentage of Americans that wouldn’t even be able to attend Kindergarten? What sorts of consequences do you think that would pose to our nation’s economic stability? I’m not sure about you but I’d certainly rather see what we have today (even if it’s not perfect) than the kind of society that would create. It’s one thing to sit from the comfort of our home and have a philosophical discussion regarding natural rights (while using a historically removed definition of slavery  mind you)  but when you actually look at the day-to-day consequences of such a proposition it’s legitimately quite scary.  &#x200B;  I won’t claim to know more than you about healthcare costs because you’re a physician and I’m not. However  it is a fact that Americans pay more for health care and  yet  on most health outcome measures under-perform compared to other industrialized countries. And if you’re concerned about debt you should also note that The UK  with its single-payer National Health Service  has a debt-to-GDP ratio of 87 percent  while Germany (with a single-payer hybrid system) carries one of the lowest debt ratios among the large  industrialized economies at 64 percent. However  according to the International Monetary Fund  the U.S. has one of the highest debt-to-GDP ratios in the world (108). In fairness  there are genuine problems the U.S. would face if it tried to replicate a single-payer system such as those in the U.K. and Europe. The vested interests enriched by the U.S. health care system are large and powerful — pharmaceutical companies  physicians  medical equipment manufacturers  insurance companies — and would all be adversely affected by the implementation of any form of universal health care  be it a single-payer system or a public-private hybrid (such as in Germany). I think you alluded to this toward the end of your reply. For example  it’s a fact that U.S. physicians are paid twice as much  on average  as physicians in other wealthy countries. Keep in mind that doctors in other wealthy countries don’t pay to attend medical school  so they don’t need to earn as high of a salary as doctors here do to maintain a comparable (if not better) standard of living because they aren’t paying off six figures in student loan debt. What’s even more pressing though is not the salary of doctors but the fact that U.S. pharmaceutical companies aren’t subjected to sufficient price competition. This is because U.S. law prohibits Medicare from negotiating prices directly with drug companies  drug companies game the system to block generic competition and keep drug prices up  and drug companies pass on the costs of research and development to American consumers. This cycle continues when pharmaceutical companies finance political candidates who then protect (and enhance) their economic interests any way they can. This is probably why you will see that most candidates who are supporting a single-payer system don’t take money from pharmaceutical companies or corporate interests. When you keep all of this in mind it becomes much easier to see how interwoven all of this really is and what it’s really all about — corporate power and greed. We simply don’t have our priorities straight. And I really think our time would be better served crafting a plan to make this potentially possible because people are dying as we speak. I’d rather retreat from armchair philosophy if it means changing that  and I hope as a physician you would too.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.101891386,17020,

His starting pay (about 15 years ago) was 2-3X what my starting pay way with a master's. He has an associates. I think nursing is more competitive now than is was then so you probably want more than an associate's. If you want to work in public health a nursing degree should be fine. But if you want to be a nurse an MPH will be useless without also going to nursing school. I would def start with the nursing degree and only consider adding an MPH if you fund not having it is you back. As others gave said get the nursing degree if you want to do clinical work. If you want to be an epidemiologist you will probably want a PhD.  I have an MPH in epidemiology an very few jobs will accept that as enough. It will be tough to find a job that is both clinical and has research elements with either nursing or an MPH or both.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.059059829,18874,

Back before my mom got her job  she was working as a regular nurse in a doctor's office. She's now over emergency preparedness/epi. You can tell they are squashed for resources because she covers 3 different jobs still.      She says that back then  (in the late 90's  early 00's) it was much easier to get a job in epi because no one really heard of it. It wasn't as big as it is now I feel.      There's no doubt that being a nurse has helped her. She was there for many outbreaks  hurricane Katrina  etc. There's just not as much funding anymore. After the hurricane  for example  they had loads to spend on disaster planning with local fire departments  airports.      She's done a bunch of stuff and I'm really jealous  but right now it's kinda flooded. I mean  every time I come on this subreddit  it's people wanting to get into epi about 80% of the time. I don't know much about it. I'm in health IT  which definitely needs at least a little clinical background. If I had gotten my nursing license  I would have a huge leg up.
