0,Razorray21,Has anyone migrated away from an EMR called PrognoCIS ?,This seemed like the best (actually populated) sub for this  but feel free to direct me to a more appropriate one.   I have a customer that is migrating away from them  and has a local server. We are trying to get a dump of the EMR for the new service  but the current provider is being really shady about it  and trying to gouge for $2K  and have been dragging their feet to even get a quote to them for it.   I know it is a long shot  but has anyone migrated away from this app  and have any idea how to create a dump of the EMR info? Im guessing it's either in the app  or something with SQL  but I haven't found anything in the app itself under the admin account.,,No video,2019-07-16 06:22:27,1.0,2.0,0.0,sliderkb2,If you can get access to the database the new vendor might be able to extract the needed records in the format they're looking for. We had to do this a couple of times. Also if you run reports via a secondary server and it has a copy of the database in a different format you might be able to use that. I've never actually migrated or heard of that particular EMR but it's worth a shot.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.1628787878787879,17418,-0.25

If you thought you might want to stay  you might consider going to a larger organization that can pile less work on you and let you focus more - it comes with its own set of challenges and bureaucracy for sure  but the org I'm with is big enough that we have teams that aren't support/have no on call (good because I would die)  most people don't have to run meetings  etc.  Our leaders are great and caring and would absolutely want to know that you are miserable  and if your manager knows how stressed you are and isn't being helpful that's on them.    Anyway  that said  as an Epic analyst you are super resourceful  you've got customer support experience  you've obviously learned a ton of different systems  you've probably had to deal with making big picture solutions  you've run a department meeting... lots of transferrable skills here.

To be honest  I'm not sure if it is either nature of the job vs specific organization (culture/intensity of new position). I think it's a combination of the people on my team  getting days off denied since so many projects are happening  and a few other things that were promised that I didn't get/things that were added later on that were never brought up. You're 100% correct  I receive a message from a recruiter once every two weeks about an open position. Epic is expanding and I think it will essentially be everywhere in the next 5-7 years.   &#x200B;  My on-call rotation isn't terrible. We have 9 people in the rotation including myself. I'll get one month where I am on for 7 days and other months where I'm not on at all. Sometimes I get forced into switching with people or taking it off their plate which isn't fun. That sounds awful having half your team quit. Our help desk always comes to us first for problems (most of the time it's not even for my team). I'm hoping my team can establish workarounds  it's just difficult since I am only certified in Cadence and my team is both Cadence and ADT (Grand Central) so I receive calls for both applications.

Everyone I know only lasts for at most two years then they have to sign a 2 year non compete agreement and can't work in healthcare for two years. Consulting is interesting  I wouldn't mind the traveling but I hate the fact that I can be asked a random question at any moment. If I could swing some remote consulting gigs (we hired a woman earlier this year who did that)  I would consider it. You're 100% correct  my old employer was digging deep into the Patient generate health data. They hired a few more analysts for My Chart along with implementing dashboards for healthy planet so providers new who needed a certain test based on rules created. The list of organizations that use Epic is growing exponentially each year and it's definitely going to be tough to walk away with all of the opportunities present.   &#x200B;  thanks for replying!,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.052940974369545805,17453,

48,The_Techie_Chef,Cert/credential recommendations,Hey healthit-  I’ve been in IT for a bit over 10 years  first in a call center for support/helpdesk - then I moved to deskside support  and by that time I was done with my BS in Systems Security and got a gig in security working for state government. Currently I work primarily with security accounts management including AD security  account and NTFS provisioning  and security direction for software development and implementation projects.  I’m wondering what credentials might make me an attractive candidate to the healthcare industry. In the past I’ve held A+ and Security+ certs  and I’m currently working on (ISC)2 SSCP  as well as planning to get CISSP next - hopefully by the end of the year.   What are the best HIPAA based certs and/or more general IT Security leaning certs that hospitals and healthcare organizations look for?  Thanks   -TTC,,No video,2019-07-14 12:58:02,1.0,1.0,0.0,SpinMasterTH,Since you're looking at Health Care - why ignore the HCISPP from (ISC)2?,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.0,17466,0.061

I also support CPACS for cardiology  so I know just as much about cardiology as I do radiology. On top of that  I work with a lot of the other ancillary departments because they rely on PACS also. The biggest thing I have learned with this work is to look at the department's leadership and radiologists/cardiologists.  I almost never work overtime  and it is me and one other admin. I work Monday - Friday 8-5  plus have my own office. I am on call every other week but get anywhere from 0 - 2 calls a week. It comes down to staff working if I get calls or not  we have a pretty automated system. We use Meditech Magic ITS RIS and Fuji Synapse PACS. The modalities are all worklist driven  plus we have super users for each modality for each shift. If I do get calls it is normally staff forgetting something  which most of the time is documented and we are able to point them to their modalities workbook and that is the end of the call. Once a month or so I do get something that requires attention  like for example IT updated firewalls one night and after this  we were unable to DICOM Transfer files.  If you have an opportunity this can really open doors depending on your career goals. Like for me  I was working on getting to work on Epic once we began to change EMRs. I am starting as an Epic Analyst later this year when the project begins  there are a lot of factors that lead to me getting this position  but my clinical experience from supporting PACS definitely helped. PACS Admins have certifications they can get as well  plus there are a lot of systems that plug into PACS i.e. dictation  RIS  CAD  etc. Sometimes these have certs as well. I don't see a lot of openings for PACS Admins in my area  but that is not true of everywhere  and the ones I do see pay well.  Really it comes down to this look at your career goals  does this aline with them? Also  $2/hour more at salary may not be a pay raise. When you are hourly you earn OT pay and shift differentials  none of that exists for salary. Some places pay call pay for salary employees  some do not. I get an extra chunk of money for my time but don't get paid for calls. While an hourly employee gets paid for their time and gets their hourly rate for calls.  As far as remote that also depends on the organization  we are not allowed remote work in my PACS position  but my new Epic position will allow it (same organization). It entirely comes down to the department and/or organization policy.  If you have any questions let me know!,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.09835517335517337,17468,

89,LinearFluid,Anyone have the perfect program to scan ID's and Insurance Cards that will place both sides if using a duplex printer ino a single jpeg.,I thought I would ask here. I would think it would be something simple to do.  You scan an ID or insurance card in a Duplex page scanner  The ones that Ambir and its Divisions  Docketport  and Inuvio produce. It will then place both sides into one Jpeg image.  &#x200B;  Having an Orthopaedic Surgeon as a client which has a high number of new patients this feature would be great for checking in.  &#x200B;  Currently the EHR provided Docketport 667s and use the Docketscan program. Process given to them Uses a custom image size  put the card in and catch it when it comes out the back and turn it over and insert it back in to get it on one image. Plus the USB B connection and socket coming out the back is wearing out on these machines from when they grab the card and put downward pressure on the plug.  &#x200B;  I looked at replacing the Docketscan with NAPS2 it looked promising  have requested this feature to be added in a ticket and also tried discussing it in the Github Forum but received not much interest.  &#x200B;  Does anyone have a solution or thought about a solution where with a Duplex Scanner you can scan both sides and place the images into a single jpeg.   &#x200B;  The one feature that is nice with NAPS2 unlike Docketscan is that it will auto-crop to the cards actual size.

However  it often seems (to me  anyway)  like an attempt to shoehorn the latest hot concept into a field that doesn't really need it. The Swiss approach towards reuse of EHR data uses homomorphic encryption: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5961814/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5961814/)  These folks presented at AMIA this year about blockchain  but seemed like a purely theoretical exercise. While the paper was well-written  I didn't attend the presentation and a lot of the folks I talked to said it seemed like a bit of a stretch: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6371378/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6371378/)  That said  both of those have to do with the pretty small niche of CRI  and you asked about health IT in general.

Curious about everyone's thoughts and impacts it might have.  *****************************************************************************************  PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP IS PUTTING AMERICAN PATIENTS FIRST BY MAKING HEALTHCARE MORE TRANSPARENT  “We should also require drug companies  insurance companies  and hospitals to disclose real prices to foster competition and bring costs down.” – President Donald J. Trump  IMPROVING PRICE AND QUALITY TRANSPARENCY: President Donald J. Trump is delivering on his promise to bring more healthcare price and quality transparency for American patients.  * President Trump is signing an Executive Order that directs his Administration to take steps to improve price and quality transparency in healthcare. * The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will require hospitals to publicly disclose prices that reflect what patients and insurers actually pay in an easy-to-read  patient-friendly format. * At President Trump’s direction  HHS will begin the process of making information on out-of-pocket spending more readily available for patients before they receive care. * Researchers  innovators  and providers will get more access to data that will help them develop tools to provide patients with more information about healthcare prices and quality. * The Administration will improve quality measurements and make them public. * The President’s order also increases incentives for patients to shop and compare services by expanding the advantages of money-saving Health Savings Accounts.   EMPOWERING PATIENTS WITH INFORMATION: Our healthcare system has long hid the true cost of care  keeping critical information from patient’s hands and limiting competition.  * For too long  powerful interests have blocked patients from knowing the true price and quality of healthcare  denying them the information they need to make informed choices. * Lack of transparency contributes to soaring costs  suppressed competition  and lower quality care. * Patients face wide variations in prices  often for the same services  due to a lack of transparency. * When armed with accurate information  patients can often identify savings by shopping for healthcare services. * Publicizing the true price of healthcare services will allow Americans to make choices that fit their personal healthcare needs and financial situations. * Price and quality transparency will promote increased competition among healthcare providers  leading to better quality and more innovative healthcare.    INCREASING TRANSPARENCY TO LOWER COSTS: President Trump is working to lower healthcare costs by improving transparency and promoting competition.  * The President signed legislation to end “gag” clauses that prevented pharmacists from letting patients know about potentially lower prices for drugs. * Recently  the Trump Administration took action to require drug manufacturers to publicly disclose drug prices in their television ads. * The President has taken action to empower consumers and expand affordable options like Health Reimbursement Arrangements  short-term plans  and Association Health Plans. * In 2018  President Trump launched a blueprint on ways to drive down drug prices and find savings for American patients. * After announcing the blueprint  more than a dozen major drug makers enacted price freezes  reductions  or rollbacks. * Last year  prescription drug prices decreased for the first time in nearly 50 years.",,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.15375295508274228,17578,

Anyone know the 411?,,No video,2019-06-22 05:42:50,3.0,5.0,1.0,JuJu_Be, Beginning May 31  2019  AHIMA will no longer offer the Certified Professional in Health Informatics (CPHI) credential or any of the various Certified Healthcare Technology Specialist credentials (specifically  CHTS-CP  CHTS-IM  CHTS-IS  CHTS-PW  CHTS-TR  and CHTS-TS).   The decision was made by the Commission on Certification for Health Informatics and Information Management (CCHIIM) in an effort to align with AHIMA’s current strategy as well as trends in the health information management field. CCHIIM provides strategic oversight of all AHIMA certification programs and is the sole and independent authority in all matters pertaining to certification and ongoing recertification of HIM professionals.   An assessment of the credentials found that demand for the CPHI and the CHTS credentials is low while the level of resources needed to develop exams for the credentials is high.   Individuals who hold these credentials can continue to use them but will no longer be required to report CEUs to maintain them.   In addition  AHIMA will no longer offer exams for these credentials. If you applied for the credential  but have not taken the exam  AHIMA will refund your exam fee.   The sunsetting of these credentials does not affect other AHIMA credentials. If you do not hold a CPHI or CHTS credential  there is no action needed.

Each section is not exclusive to a single aptitude as there is some carry over in between. Also despite being a successful IT company the Mac support on the assessment software is from 2014 which I found funny. So know how to allow cookies in the newest version of Safari before you begin if you’re using that. I also think the phone interviewer lulls you into being overly casual but it’s being recorded and HR listens to it. “They” also say if you go on site to dress casual but statistically speaking people who go business casual get job offers more than those who don’t.

That said I believe it's completely possible to work in any of the EMR teams (applications  technical  teaching  etc.).  I strongly believe anyone can succeed in IT if you have a strong ability to solve problems using logic/algorithms.  I had a BS in MT and worked on the bench for a year before I moved on to the LIS team at another organization while working on my MS in CS.  I made the switch for the same reasons.  I knew a bench job would be safe but the ceiling for salary and advancement is low.  I worked with a great group of people but I simply wasn't challenged and felt like I wasn't learning as much as I wanted to at the time.  Additional degrees are definitely not required but it was a personal decision of mine that ended up helping me career-wise.  I was also in my 20s at the time and had a lot more energy to work full-time and take classes in the evenings.  I'd say explore the fields you're interested in.  Try some Udemy classes and see if you like the data science fields.  Learning to code from websites  forums and youtube is completely possible but I'd focus on the higher level languages.   Check all of the hospitals around.  They're always hiring healthcare professionals that want to transition to IT.

I suggest you keep an eye out for ways to improve any of the reports you currently work with or perhaps even talk with clinic managers  billers/coders  etc. on what kinds of new reporting data you think you could use to improve your day-to-day. Here’s an example: if you think coders process too many charges unnecessarily  your team could run a report to see how many charges come through with attributes that make them unnecessary for review  then use the results to triage the issue and figure out how to best fix it. In that scenario  I’d talk to a coding manager to see if they share your perception  then work with them to log a request for this report  help out with running the report when it’s created  and participate however you can in any follow-up actions based on the info gleaned.  In my opinion  I think that would show that you understand operational needs  which is something orgs really want from their analysts if you want to go down that path  and you could also get some knowledge about how the database works — especially if you ask analysts how they’re finding the data and building the reports.  Hope this helps. Best of luck! :),,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.2036075036075036,17648,

Your understanding is spot on. Certification-level scores on a proficiency (what Epic calls ""proficiency with honors"") should qualify you for the certification once you go out to Verona for training.  Now that you have your UserWeb and practice/project environment access  yes  you want to work through the training companions in the order listed on the Course Catalog using the classroom information sheets to do all the exercises. Do **all** the exercises; trust me  most of the exam/project content is there. Permitting  you are using the training guide for the Epic version they're certifying on right now -- which is ver. February 2019 now through this fall -- it will be the exact same training companion they give you when you're onsite to certify. If you train on ver. February 2019 now but don't go out to Epic until the trainings are on ver. May 2019  for example  you may need to complete your New Version Trainings (NVTs) prior to going.   The self-assessment is an open-book  open-system test for you to check your understanding: a practice exam. It sounds like it will be your first introduction to the tricky  esoteric way Epic writes their questions  so don't expect a 100% on your first try. I recommend you take very detailed notes along with highlighting in the training companion as well as screenshots from the exercises and store them in a OneNote because there will be very specific questions on the practice and final exams.

I worked for Cerner then started with a health system that had me get proficient in Epic. It’s pretty uncommon for systems to get people proficient instead of certified (but it’s the cheap option...) and I’ve never heard of an Epic consultant who wasn’t certified so  in my experience  I wouldn’t bank on being a shoe-in analyst hire if you’re proficient but haven’t worked in that role before. Don’t worry  you’ll get there; just look for opportunities to get working in the system so you have experience to talk about in interviews :) I personally made the switch to a role that got me certified to make sure I’m an attractive candidate.  As far as build goes  you’ll get to do a lot of that in training. If Cadence/Prelude follows the pattern I’m used to with Ambulatory and Research  the 100 training book is very basic workflow stuff and then 200 and 400 is more build-heavy. You’ll do some build in Hyperspace which a graphical interface and pretty easy to use. Text  which you’ll use for duplicating records  imports/exports  and lots of build tools  is more finicky because it’s a command line interface (similar to if you’ve ever played around in Windows Command Prompt or Linux or even DOS). The training companion will go over how to use Text but it’s really a practice-makes-perfect sort of tool. If what the training companions tell you about build seems like a lot to remember  there are lots of Setup and Support type Galaxy (the Epic wiki) articles out there that give you step-by-step build instructions for most scenarios.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.31754385964912285,17653,

For mine  we have ""2nd tier"" Epic support staff who take calls directly from help desk to assist with Epic build/profile-related issues.  We also have ""3rd tier"" which is your more traditional Epic analyst who both take more complex support calls  and perform the build work.  The latter pays a bit better generally  but the former is more accessible  especially if you're on Help Desk and have the interest/experience to go there.  &#x200B;  Perhaps more importantly  both groups are Epic certified  and were sponsored by the organization.  If an Epic analyst is the way you want to go  your priority should probably be getting certified.  Since that requires sponsorship  step 1 (aside from doing good work in your current position  establishing yourself in health IT  and exploring possibilities) is applying for analyst positions you're interested in which include sending you to training.  &#x200B;  I just left the more ""technical"" realm of health IT last month to start as an Epic analyst.  It was a sideways move  which is somewhat frustrating considering I have more qualification in this position by way of a new Bachelor's  but it's a similar position as you're in - or might be in a year or so.  Hope everything goes well for you.  Help Desk  as an entry-level position  is often frustrating and monotonous compared to other IT careers  all I can say is stick with it  find a specialty you're passionate about  and take action on it.",,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.1334152334152334,17675,

Analytics is HUGE so yes SQL is a very marketable skill to have. And if you're looking to get into IT in general  just having that analytical ability is a useful skill outside of SQL.  Informatics where I'm at has its own department   so depending on the organization you can just apply right for those jobs. They will usually take you if you have the clinical part down  you can learn the tech stuff. This actually holds true for analyst positions as well  healthcare is pretty unique in that aspect they'll take you for a tech job with little tech background. Quite a few of our Epic analysts and trainers here were RNs or techs prior to this.  See if there are any internships being offered at your organization is the best I can think of for exposure though  outside of just networking with people (as a superuser you likely already have a bit of exposure with your informatics and analyst teams?)  Short answer is just put yourself out there and apply for things  worse thing they can say is no  just don't let it get to you if that happens and keep trying :),,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.13406911375661376,17676,0.163

If you are interested in coding I'd suggest you'd start learning data science with Python. If you want to get to know the health IT field in general and want to focus less on data science or programming it really depends on the country you live in. Go to health IT fares if there are any nearby and get to know the industry  which is always a good starting point. You can figure out from there if you want to specialise in a specific domain and/or type of IT. My personal advice would always be to find out what the market for health IT is in your country and if there are any courses  seminars or fares you can attend.

Long post ahead:  I rely very heavily on the ability to take a small amount of information from the customer and extrapolate that into what the actual task is and how to take the next steps. Thinking on your feet will take you far.  I learned about this whole field from a 10 minute conversation at a job fair. No joke.   A typical work day is very dynamic. Tasks are continually being reprioritized and moved around to accommodate new items. I work closely with project managers and providers to organize tasks and verify clinical content for my build. Collaboration skills and flexibility are a huge plus. The tasks you do will depend on your EHR  your area of expertise  and your organization so this is hard to generalize.   Hiring - much the same as any competitive job  you want to come in prepared but also show that you’re a real person who can handle themselves and their work outside of the interview script. If your university has a career counseling center I would definitely recommend using it to prepare.   Masters degree is 100% not required for my job. You could probably go for a managerial position if you already have one.   Competition is no joke in this field. People frequently move cross country for entry level positions. If you’re willing to move  apply out of state. People stay in these jobs for decades  find a growing institution.   Pros - I have an amazing team and we work well together. We all have our own strengths and work to create a cohesive whole. I feel well supported as an analyst and as a person. I get to dig into the more difficult build tasks and find hidden gems that make our system run more effectively.  I am largely allowed to manage my time as I choose and have been since day 1.  For all of this  ymmv. Enjoying puzzles and strategy games in real life would make you well suited for this field.   Cons - the workload can be high sometimes  but it’s also very rewarding. If you’re not a fan of travel that’s a con.   If you can  get a membership to HIMSS or AMIA and go to a conference  see if you can get a mentor  etc. Conferences are great for networking and learning about the upcoming hot button topics.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.17501755001755007,17696,

CAHIIM has a website that lists all currently accredited schools and often mentions which ones are in process as well.   As the other person mentioned accreditation is extremely important when it comes to sitting for the exams. It can also take a long time for a school to get their accreditation.   What this means is if you finish your program and  your state school hasn't received accreditation you will not be able to sit for the RHIA exam until they receive it.   my suggestion would be to try to have a candid conversation with the staff at the local school and see where they're at in the process.  That said I have been through both the two year (RHIT) and four year (RHIA) and if I had personally known about WGU I might not have even gone to the two year school.   I have a lot of college (HIM is not my first career path) and I have never felt more supported and consistently guided as I did in WGU's BSHI program.   I can talk for ages about it  but I have gone to two Community Colleges  one major four year University in my state  and WGU and WGU was my best (and cheapest) experience by far.

I would definitely say you can make decent money with this degree  Based on my experience in the HIM world I would say the degree is definitely worth the money. There are a lot of ways you can go within HIM.

There is a lot more to HIM than just diagnosis and procedure coding for billing!   If you are interested in more of a management angle then I would consider schools like St. Scholastica's online program. If you are interested in IT then Western Governors is the best program.   &#x200B;  I loved WGU's program because it had enough an IT side to it that I could understand enough about the process of building relational diagrams and how databases are made without needing a full IT degree.

Clarity is the more complex reporting option with 12 000 tables and is a pain to work with. Epic caboodle is a simplified version with most of what you would want. I use clarity because It has virtually everything and I got used to it since I work with it almost every day.  For adhoc reporting I just run queries using sql management studio and dump into a csv or excel. For standard reporting I just have data dump into a BI tool Qlik (similar to tableau).   Many of the excel reports used in the hospital are reporting workbench reports that run off the live Cache production database and real time data.

Literally almost anything can be queried if you study the data dictionary and learn what views contain the data you’re looking for.

I was the only billing person at a small Psych hospital. It was glorified data entry  but you learn a lot about hospital data by looking at what goes on a bill.  Well  in 2004  the psych hospital payment methods from Medicare we're going to change. So  I read up on the new model and wondered how'd it affect our reimbursement. I googled and learned how to pull the data out of our billing system so I could have a year's worth of patient data to put into a model. I built the model using Medicare documentation on codes  rates and days stayed.    Owners were flabbergasted when I showed them.  They never asked me to do it  I just showed up with Excel charts and data. We were a small place with at most 30 employees...we didn't have reimbursement modelers. I projected changing reimbursement over three years...as Medicare was easing it in over 3 years instead of all at once. It basically said.....we got 3 mil in 2004  going forward if we had the same patients in 2005 we'd get 2.7 mil  in 2006   2.5 mil and 2.4 mil in 2007. When the change did happen  my model was accurate within a dollar from what Medicare was paying.  Owners sold the place  new owners weren't as great and a lotta employees left. I took a job at a 250 bed acute hospital as an analyst in a process improvement department. When I went to my interview I showed the model  and I showed I understood the data that went into it.  I think that alone got me that job.  I was about 24 at the time. Was doing the billing job just as I finished a degree in management. Worked a few years at the large acute and jumped into a MBA with healthcare focus program that was an every other Saturday attendance thing.   I hope the example helps.

We're at a point where we're needing to scale to 24x7 support due to customer demand and some near-term SLAs.  However  the reality is we're not a huge company ~60-65 staff and we don't have a ton of night / weekend interface issues.  I'd say we average 1 issue every 5-6 weeks... and most issues are resolved with a 'turn it off  turn it on' approach.

Setup good monitoring protocols including at least: ping/heartbeat  HL7 queue count threshold  and port up/down.   Setup alerts to notify via whatever method is acceptable to you (pagers actually still exist for this and are very reliable!) Then do a rotation through your support staff. Offer an hourly incentive for being on-call ($2.50/hr?) and a full wage if they are called in with an hourly minimum for responding to an alert. ,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.16666666666666666,17845,0.097

Our west coast US customers were irritated at the short hours previous  but now can leave either next day or immediate support tickets with a live operator. I don't know the service cost  but negligible vs an FTE. We have also let a few support staff switch to a later 11-7 shift to extend office hours as well  working well so far. If it's all service based  getting some heartbeat monitoring with notification can head off the call in the first place.

I've not yet run into a HL7 issue that requires on-the-spot resolution. VPN issues only if this brings down the entire client (haven't had that yet either).   So here's how I would plan it:  Rotating after-hours schedule for existing FTE  answering service is really only needed from say 8p-12a est  and weekends normal working hours. These hours should be clearly documented on your Company's support web page. Answering service should take down name of client  scope of impact and best number to call back.  ,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.104320987654321,17848,

Are you in a clinical environment  or just remote support? Inpatient/surgical  or just ambulatory care?   While this is probably the most frequently uttered reason for damn near anything in our field; its really going to depend on the facility.  For instance  I support many sites where I've built HL7 interfaces for Radiology Orders and Results (ORM/ORU messages only). At our smaller sites that are only performing radiography (aka plain film) its not a big deal if the interfaces go down in the middle of the night  because they are not receiving nighthawk services. However  for our larger facilities with inpatient and emergency care  when you have a trauma patient that needs immediate care at 3am  you better believe those links and pipes had better be operational.  My recommendation would be to assign your existing staff to an on-call rotation. Company issues laptop  a hardware VPN tunnel  and appropriate compensation for on-call work would be the direction that I would try to go.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.14056437389770726,17850,

We're in the same boat. We run about 1000 interfaces  some of them powering some pretty critical workflows like telestroke/secure messaging/clinical decision support  etc. We have to work late nights for some cutovers and someone is always on call but they are rarely tagged into action.  We have 24/7 Sev 1 support  which has pretty much always met our needs. A support ticket or call to the main line pages someone with a 30 minute ITR.  ""Someone"" should be able to remediate the infrastructure issues themselves post ITR. This person doesn't need to be highly trained.  There are a bunch of things your interface stack needs to be able to do to get there.  1. The first thing I like to tell customers about support is ""there is no such thing as a data mapping emergency"". If something fails because data was mapped incorrectly and we didn't catch it in testing and you signed off on it  it's not getting fixed at 3AM. That's not sev1 support. Depending on the criticality of the situation  we may still pull someone in late at night  but we're not obligated to do so. If your customers have an expectation that you'll fix a data mapping emergency post go-live honeymoon period at 3AM  you probably need to reel that one back in. 2. Your interfaces should obviously try to recover from failures on both ends of the pipe. Sending systems should queue and resend if your interface layer is unresponsive and the interface layer should queue and resend if the health system is unresponsive. Most interface engines do this like Mirth  but if you rolled your own stack you need to make sure it does this. Having to have someone trigger a queue unload in the middle of the night because one system was unresponsive for a minute is obviously bad systems design. 3. You should track things that kill your interface stack religiously and fix them aggressively. For Mirth  those two things are Memory and Disk. If you run out of memory  Mirth starts acting weird. If you run out of disk on your database  Mirth stops working. Make sure you keep an eye on your metrics for those two items (and anything specific to your integration stack) and make sure your on-call sev 1 person can fix those problems. This is obviously a much easier problem to solve if you are in the cloud. If you are tied to strict infra requirements on prem or in a colo  you should obviously pad the crap out of your interface stack to make sure a surge of traffic or idiotic thing doesn't sink your battleship. You can set these things up to autoscale on the cloud... just make sure you autoscale enough to meet your needs (e.g. you can only resize EBS volumes to refresh IOPS once every few hours). 4. The on call staff should be able to perform CPR on your infrastructure. Reboot servers. Reboot databases. Recycle VPN connections. We have runbooks for all of these items that the sev 1 support can run through. This actually fixes 99% of our Mirth/VPN problems. Very rarely does something get really out of hand  and when it has (which has been extremely rare for us) it was in the early days when we didn't aggressively follow rule #3. 5. If you do let engineers make changes to your interface stack in the middle of the night  make sure that they don't do anything that could break something that they can't remediate themselves. If your interface people don't know how to bring back the infrastructure from a failed state and it doesn't fix itself  they need to have a dev ops person on hand when making changes (or just do it during business hours). 6. If you do have anything super critical  it should be easy to wire those channels errors into PagerDuty/Zendesk. For a few specific instances  an error immediately wakes someone up and we don't wait for things to try to resolve immediately. I don't think we have any customers who have an expectation that they will get someone on the phone 24/7  but depending on your business I could see how that would be true.  I don't think Epic had a NOC until they had a hosting business. Your business probably doesn't need one either.",,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.08879310344827586,17851,

Those two issues make it really difficult to justify hiring FTEs for nights  weekends  and holidays.  Have any of you had to set-up something similar?  I'm researching using our Vonage business virtual PBX for rotating call routing  and I'm also researching live-person call services to take down information and just reach out to a schedule of staff that may be available (although finding a 24x7 live call service is harder than I thought).  One thing I can say is that we're not willing to outsource the actual support services.  That review needs to be performed by existing FTEs due to HIPAA/HITRUST policies we have.

Your internal policies are the thing that says how you will do it.  SOC-2 is an audit by a third party to certify you did what you said you would do.  So  one way to demonstrate to business partners and government that you are HIPAA compliant is to adopt the SOC-2 framework internally  implement  and certify. This does not certify you as HIPAA compliant - there is no such thing - but it does certify you as SOC-2 compliant  which is often the starting point for interoperating.

For example if you do medical imaging and you are going to partner with Hospital A they will most likely require you have some certs like SOC 2 to show that you are secure in some manner.  Hospital A doesn't and should not just trust you with their PHI even if you have a BAA in place since a BAA no longer covers someone like it used to.  To be SOC 2 or HITRUST it means an approved 3rd party company came in looked at everything and put their name on the line that you are not jacked up.    These requirements will grow  not shrink.

HIPAA/HITECH is the regulation dictating how you must manage protected health information (PHI). SOC compliance can be a large undertaking and for small organizations may be overkill for certain companies. If you are using a cloud provider such as Amazon Web Services you are able to [leverage their SOC Reports](https://www.dashsdk.com/resource/leveraging-aws-soc1-soc2-and-soc3/) as well as their provided [security programs](https://www.dashsdk.com/resource/amazon-web-services-security-certifications/). Many healthcare vendors build a security program around HIPAA and provide their AWS SOC2 Report as part of vendor security assessment for a health provider.

I get that clunky workflows are both inefficient and frustrating but my larger points are 1)  the software is a toolbox  not a single tool  2) people who aren't comfortable with the tool interface end up hating the tool and 3) a more sustainable and direct approach than customizing and streamlining the tool (further differentiating it from all others and making it harder to interoperate) would be to change the ways we are using it.   Related to point 1  the real issue people seem to have is how much we require them to do with the wrong combination of tools. Related to point 2  having been an implementer and now an end-user I have noticed that the most vocal and staunch critics are people who are not as comfortable using computers or who vastly over-simplify the way systems are set up (e.g.  comparing it to using your ATM in a remote part of the world). That is not their fault but it definitely skews how seriously I take their criticisms. To point 3  just like point 1  maybe we should ask what the purpose of the EHR really is and then change the way it is used to best accomplish that- if we are able to eliminate clicks  why were they there in the first place?  I'm not saying there isn't room for improvement  there is bad software out there and great software that is being deployed poorly. I am just saying most physicians and admins address the wrong parts of the problem by going after use and not purpose.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.1052545155993432,17890,

Instead of excel  an informatician would be using SQL  R  Python  and visualization tools like ggplot or tableau.   There are a couple of paths you could head down  based off your statement it sounds like you enjoy the training side of IT  but I don’t know if you have tried the analytical side yet. There are certificates from AHIMA that would help you get your foot in the door  but the impression I get is that their health informatics certificate (CPHI) is too new to know if it is worth it  most hiring managers are more familiar with something like RHIT. FYI  a lot of the certificates from AHIMA require graduating from an accredited or recognized program. Keep that in mind if you plan on pursuing one of these.  You could pursue a graduate certificate in informatics  those are anywhere from nine credits to up to 20-30. The programs are probably going to offer either soft technical skills or hard skills. The soft technical skills will be more about project management  and the hard skills would be learning coding  databases  and software development.  Nursing informatics programs will give you more experience towards the training and super user side of the spectrum. You would learn about interoperability challenges  systems selection and evaluation  and project management. A degree in heath or clinical informatics (they are basically interchangeable) will bring in some of those technical skills a little more. Pushing further into the hard skills will probably see more alignment with clinical research informatics  where you would be developing FHIR apps or working on how to bring over bench discoveries from bioinformatics to the bedside along with those working in the translational informatics field. I’d suggest taking a look at AMIA (https://www.amia.org) to get a better idea of the flavors of informatics available to get into. They also have an informatics programs search tool (https://www.amia.org/education/programs-and-courses). There are several programs you can explore  from the accelerated graduate certificates or AMIA 10x10s  to full masters or doctorate programs. Once you get a better idea of what you want to do  it will become easier to find a program that can help you build that skill set.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.18845147907647908,17909,

Thanks for the post. I’m on the IT application side  and I work with Epic. Healthcare is just a huge mess right now even if you remove EHRs from the equation.  EHRs bring a lot of benefits that we didn’t have on paper  but there is clearly a blurred line between human error and broken software when it comes to patient safety and medical errors as outlined in the article.   Thousands of people have been dying from medical errors way before the broad adoption of EMR systems. To Err is Human came out in 1999  which found as many as 98 000 people died every year from medical errors that could have been prevented. You throw EMR systems into that mix and it’s not surprising to hear stories about software errors or providers using the system incorrectly to inadvertently harm patients. However  patient safety is so much more complex than than just provider or system errors. There’s a whole framework of factors that contribute to each adverse event. I recommend reading Kerm Henriksen’s [human factors framework](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK2666/) for a better understanding of this.   That’s why patient safety should be one of the highest priorities when designing an EMR system. The benefits of an EMR like data validation (checks that you actually entered a number for blood pressure instead of text for example) and clinical decision support should extend to the prevention of medical errors that could impact patient safety. Unfortunately  there are so many disparate systems and even customized variations within the same systems between hospitals that it has made things like clinical decision support very difficult to be made portable and broadly adopted. The lack of standards or rather the lack of consensus on which standards to use only further exacerbate this problem. On top of this  the government never made it required by law for these EMRs to be interoperable. Epic is interoperable as long as you’re using their suite of applications - there’s no incentive to connect with other systems. Instead the goal is to get as many customers on your EMR as possible.   It’s going to be a very long time before this is all sorted out but I hope to be one of the people who does it. ,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.07826254826254828,17919,

I used to implement three ehrs  one fully from the back end to the client. We had a whole division of trainers on standby  even on call 24/7  even then adoption and adherence were an issue. The point made about Rikers was present too - customizations made to outsmart the ehr to do what the provider wanted to do  they'd port those customizations over to other providers who maybe used a chunk of it but not all. Upgrades were always a challenge.  On top of all that they had (most likely still have) a huge patient safety issue where they maintained a copy of the production environment with which to report against  which was refreshed with live production data every 15 minutes. Specific divisions whose job it was to support the individual modules or add-ons would routinely log into this environment to view patient data  that is patient data belonging to other coworkers  themselves  people they knew in the community  friends  etc.  There was no real way to audit this as they'd use a shared account  off a connection brokered from a non-persistent vm  and I don't know how to get this information to the right people  but I can only imagine what is going on today that I don't know about. ,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.14541634835752482,17921,

Then of course you have taken info out of the most secure place the EHR and put it as a file on the Hard Drive which is encrypted but still people forget to delete it. Patient Portals. Have Direct Messaging without any way to do attachments. You cant send a patient anything but text and they can't send you anything but text.    Walk into a private practice and you will find half a dozen different PACS programs installed on computers munching away at resources  as every CD brought in from a different place has you install their DICOM Viewer. This should of been another easy fix.  One dedicated machine locked down  virus scanned sandboxed and hardened so you can rest assured that when you get outside CD's and USB drives they are sandboxed on that machine  You then put the CD or USB Drive in and it will find the patient and image info in an XML info file and load them to the Machines PACS system from the CD. Then any machine with a DICOM Viewer can get the info. Then once done the machine will store it for 30 days and Purge or there would be an option to insert into the practices EHR or extend the purge date. If it purges in 30 days that is longer than that info would of been kept by the physician as the CD would be shredded immediately if the patient did not want to take it since it has to be stored by the site that took the images and not the Physician. Plus stacks of CDs laying around are not HIPAA.  So many lost opportunities missed to keep the subscription software services racking up the $$$$$. HL7 my foot  it is an illusion.

My education and career have both been entirely focused on Informatics and IT.    I learned about EHRs while in school  met with a few of the major vendors about employment opportunities  though I eventually turned those opportunities down.  Epic in particular has always been the most attractive to me from the perspective of an end user.  Its UX design appears to me to better align with current UX design trends  at least better than its peers.  I had always assumed that the healthcare industry had long ago adopted information technology  and i guess technically it had.  The very first EHR I saw was something text-based  Nora or Lucy or something.  It basically looked like a DOS screen  navigated like a DOS screen and it was an eye-opening experience for me. I was additionally surprised to hear that documentation and orders were still largely performed on paper  and that so many different systems were in place in hospitals to support seemingly common tasks  like placing radiology or lab orders  receiving those results  admitting a patient to the hospital   etc.  Digitization needed to happen in a big way  IMO  and though this article might paint the HITECH act as a failure  I think it only failed in achieving goals that were much too lofty.  Lest we forget  one of the biggest reasons for the push to EHR is that paper is an inherently faulty medium.  It's not searchable  it's not scalable  it's not discrete  it might not even be legible  its not instantly portable  and it's easy to lose.  Digitizing health data can solve all of these problems; even if these are not problems that have been solved yet  they're problems that CAN be solved.  I think the biggest problem though  is that healthcare itself is always going to present analog problems  for which there is no current digital solution.  I can't speak from direct experience  only vicariously through the experience of others - but i gather that patient care is a very fluid  very dynamic environment.  Variables can and do change  and sometimes problems arise which demand an out-of-the-box solution  and computers by definition cannot provide those solutions.  A computer can only provide solutions which it has been explicitly instructed it can provide.  Once upon a time some ADT system somewhere would probably be unable to reflect that a mother and child presenting after an MVA were sharing a room in the ED.  That concept of two patients in one room would be literally unthinkable for a system coded only to consider a typical 'one patient per room' scenario.  As these problems arise  developers can solve for these issues over time  but that's not helpful to you as a provider at the time of patient care.  I think a close second in the list of EHR problems is that frequently the people making design decisions are not the people that will be using the system to provide patient care every day.  I've worked with tons of physicians to receive design input  but of the 100s I've sat in a meeting room with to discuss technical and workflow details  maybe 5% were providers that were still actively caring for patients.  These were folks that by and large had moved into administration roles  and while their clinical perspectives were usually accurate and valid  I don't think people generally consider that your CMIO is not trying solve issues as a provider but as an administrator.  His bottom line isn't whether a design decision affects end users adversely  or patients adversely  it's whether it affects the bottom line adversely.  He's concerned with the cost-benefit analysis  not patient wellness.  Bottom line on this issue  IMO  is that too many are looking at this as a problem of Provider vs. EHR  when in reality hospital administration might be the biggest big stakeholder with entirely different motivations.  I do think there are some cognitive leaps that are commonly made when switching to EHR  and I'm not sure how you solve for these  honestly.  There's a very widely-held belief among end users that because EHR can do so many things for you  that of course it would do something fundamental like communicate for you as well.  And it some cases it does- it's going to get your AM labs into the hands of a phlebotomist  and your STAT head CT into the hands of an on-call radiologist.  What EHRs do NOT do is remove the need for face to face conversations among the care team or phone call between departments.  Maybe you needed an RT to get to your patient ASAP  and yes your orders are in the system  but your RT will not see them immediately unless they're also looking at the EHR in that exact moment you enter your orders.  People get upset when they hear this too  like 'I have to take care of my patients  so why isn't everyone ELSE constantly watching their screens waiting for my orders'?  Finally  while I do understand and truly sympathize that sometimes the UX is just bad and maybe downright unpleasant to do  I think the stereotype of the 'lazy physician' absolutely exists for a reason  and that maybe part of burnout is that those types of docs can no longer buck their responsibilities without getting caught.  If you haven't done your note  the system knows  and reminds you.  If you ignore those reminders  the system knows.  And for the love of god the one I least sympathize with  if you're not completing  your goddam med rec?  The system knows!  I mean  isn't med-rec one of the purest examples of medical decision-making that exists in EHR?  I certainly know all the studies that point to how vitally important it is when handing off care  and yet I encounter so many doctors that will find any reason possible to avoid it.  As far as solutions?  its important to remember that EHR is a tool  and right now yeah it's absolutely an unwieldy  clumsy  heavy one.  It's a sledge hammer when you need a framing hammer.  But just because it's not perfect doesn't mean it's not good. And even if it's NOT good  it's still probably better than what we were doing previously.  True  meaningful progress as far as UX though  I think that has to come from AI.  Right now we have a great digital tool in the hands of analog users  and usage of EHR largely comes down to translating your care into a digital record.  I truly dream of a day when someone develops a way to digitally capture patient care without input from clinicians.  Computer screens aren't where y'all belong  and it's not where anyone wants you.  I think everyone would feel better having providers spend more time at the bedside  and maybe one day we'll get there.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.07008823032759205,17927,

The programming at eCW just sounds sloppy - poorly implimented and poorly tested.   The thing about Epic not interfacing with the lab  all that is true  a lot of people don't like Beaker and it's not implemented  or implemented much later.  At our hospital it was implemented 2-3 years after go live.  We ended up creating a bunch of lab interfaces  and that's problematic - it's a source of error for sure.

So it has definitely contributed to physician burnout.   EHRs could be a LOT better.  My informatics professor summed it nicely by saying EHRs today are at the same stage as aviation was in the 1930s. It’s in its infancy and there’s a lot of improvement needed to make it safe and cost efficient. ,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.32,17939,

Because we live in a society where protecting private  proprietary  software is a greater priority than seamless access to health information.

You should understand your prescriptions and instructions.  If you don't  talk to the doctor.   &#x200B;  This is a hurdle that is very  very difficult to get over as a patient in some cases. My GF has a rare genetic condition and A LOT of doctor visits and tests. Figure 3-7 visits in a month. She is 38. I have maybe 3 in a year. It is a non-issue for me. Have you literally ever dealt with authority figures and bureaucracy that makes something seemingly impossible? It happens in medical care  too. Sometimes it doesnt matter how much you try to get involved in your own care  you still get hosed.   &#x200B;  So  let's start at her GP. Her GP is pretty good.... she had a crappy one  but it turns out her OB has a similar condition and is very understanding and agreed to be her GP. The last GP? his office literally WOULD NOT refer her for so much as an MRI. She called  she went in person basically crying  and they NEVER referred her for the MRI to another office. That is just one issue of several problems she had with that office that finally made her leave (and that part is on her for being hesitant to change  but if you keep reading  its not like there is much to get excited about)  &#x200B;  I'm gonna back up a minute  -- she also had an entirely dismissive rheumatologist. He would prescribe some pain meds  dismiss literally any other issue or question she had  be a rude fucknugget  and send her on her way. After we requested her records and changed practices we found her was basically writing off her symptoms and conditions and saying she was a hypochondriac. Hey  he is in our medical system  so every doctor can see these shit comments about my GF and immediately decide not to help! woo hoo! She has met other patients of his  they all hate the fucker  but we are in a sort of rural area and we just dont have a lot of options  right?   &#x200B;  So now she has a good GP who will work with her on one issue at a time. Let's get an MRI! Slow down  we need to refer you to a practice that can actually read an MRI related to one of her issues and treat you. That is not what the OB can do. So we are 1-3 months out at a provider to get an appointment  then another 2-4 weeks out to get the MRI  then ANOTHER 2-4 weeks to go back to the provider for a follow up.   &#x200B;  That is for one MRI (of three). For ONE section of spine at a time  because why the fuck just get a whole scan done over a couple of weeks and figure this shit out?  Ah  that section is fine  here  let's refer you to another provider  fast forward 6 weeks  and oh shit...that guy is sick. His office doesn't schedule you with another doctor when you call  they just say he is still sick  kthxbye--click. balls.   &#x200B;  Fast forward just a little Ok. the OB refers us to a 3rd clinic for a 3rd MRI. My GF asks me to go to the visit with her to new physicians because sometimes they are stupid men who dismiss women and do not care about their patients. we LEAD with 'she has a rare genetic condition that affects her connective tissue' and he follows up with a very i-dont-want-to-hear-about-it-face and 'do some yoga'.   &#x200B;  uh  hi there  you ray-liotta looking asshole  i am telling you that she CAN NOT do yoga. I have to say this  because when she says it  he completely ignores her **in front of my very face**  and only seems to respond to these concerns when i speak up--his response being  i dont care  do yoga. Fuck that guy. We never go back to him. He spent about 15 seconds looking at her MRI and explained NOTHING -- nothing. zero. 'this is fine  i wish i was i had a spine like this  let me tell you what pain is...' christ. Dude  she has been treated for chronic pain since she was 18 and i am telling you she cannot do yoga. she has done yoga. she is hypermobile. she can do all the yoga  we cant just walk into a yoga studio. can we get a PT referral? no--get another MRI and do some yoga. fuck.   &#x200B;  we call the sick doctor back  he is still sick. kthxb--no  no  not just bye  ok helen? how about do you have ANY OTHER DOCTOR IN THAT OFFICE THAT DEALS WITH NERVE ISSUES BECAUSE YOU ARE A NEUROLOGY CLINIC? oh  you do? and we can see them? thanks. thats sweet. when? a month? fine. whatever. why would you offer us to see another doctor? yours has apparently got some chronic 3-month-long-condition and you dont give a fuck.   &#x200B;  so something like 12 months after all of these try-a-doctor-and-get-some-mri's started we finally have 3 MRIs and what turns out to be the **NP** for sick-doctor who will talk to my GF. but....jackpot! she is sort of familiar with this rare condition  agrees that yoga-loving-ray-liotta-doctor was going to get her hurt even worse  and actually knows a PT office that is familiar with the condition. So we get a referral to them....only 2 weeks away. That is fast enough to be happy about something for a change  2 weeks for a referral is basically medical lightspeed. She also gives us a referral to a spine surgeon (2 months out)  out-of-network (and christ  out of our geographical region)  who is familiar with her genetic condition and has a good reputation.   &#x200B;  so we go see this guy  and honestly  he was fantastic. he was very up front about reading all 3 MRIs right in front of us  explained what he saw that has potential to be a problem  explained why some things might appear to us to be a problem but really were not the cause of her pain and was very clear that surgery was not a good option yet. He was also very understanding of her issues and listened attentively. If every doctor was even half as good as this guy we might be happy with medical care  but ffs  it took over a year of hounding practices and waiting on open appointments to just get so far as 'well  sorry  you are screwed'. Great. I dont even care about the insurance headaches and money  ok? I just want some decent medical care for it  I want her to get some help without having to nag the ever loving fuck out of every 4 of 5 practices we deal with.   &#x200B;  thats how awesome it is to try and take charge of your own care sometimes. doctors are just people -- some people truly  honestly suck. this goes for lawyers  cops  politicians  cashiers  babysitters  everyone. Some people are also awesome...but when they suck  and you have to rely on them for your care  it can get pretty insane. Hell  even good people get screwed at work by shitty work systems or by being way  way overworked themselves and they drop the ball. In the best case we have had a giant list of headaches and delays by overworked people who drop the ball a lot. it sucks.   &#x200B;  > If everyone in the care team  especially the patient  could be more proactive it would be helpful.   &#x200B;  I work in Health IT for a system with 9 hospitals and 100 clinics. There is definitely room for improvement on all sides  and there are more times than I can count that the IT staff are over-tasked and cannot fix issues for weeks to months. It is pretty damn nuts. but it is so  so frustrating to think a patient can really just ask enough questions and understand what is going on. My GF does an insane amount of medical research on all of her visits and prescriptions and diagnoses. The best that has done is gotten us a polite acknowledgement from some of the nicer providers and a lot of medical bills. She is still every bit as sick and lost and she was over a year ago when the OB-GP started to get us some referrals  her conditions are getting worse  and everyone is like 'ugh  that bites'   &#x200B;  as for me? im 35. my back hurts sometimes and i need to lose 30 lbs. its easy for me  as a guy who is genetically very fortunate and pretty healthy  to get a doctor to be like 'yeah  you need to exercise  stretch your back  and lose a few pounds' -- i am the easiest of cases. she is probably among the hardest  so i dont feel as bad about doctors being stumped as i do about a whole range of people being insanely difficult to work with when you try and take on some of the work of your own care in the first place. it is \*not\* as easy as a patient just trying to get more involved in their care.   &#x200B;  /sorry for the maybe not entirely coherent rant. ,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.07611291486291485,17949,

Plus the workforce development training (career redevelopment training program for EHRs during the recession) was all on VistA  so there would've been an added bonus of actually training people to support it.

There’s a constant push for more growth and more profits. Over time  this trickles down to a worse quality of life for doctors.  The health care industry has to show their shareholders more money every quarter  and they can’t just keep fleecing patients more  so they want doctors to see more patients in less time  do more call  have less personal time  etc. The trend is for more work for less money. EHRs are a small facet of that in that they’re made to capture more billing and aren’t as physician focused as they could be. If the EHRs were miraculously improved tomorrow  it would help but the other issues would remain.   As for positive aspects I think eventually EHRs will reduce medical errors and make doctor and patient lives easier but it’s not quite there yet. They do facilitate things like allowing me to check a patients studies from home and sometimes save me a trip to the hospital when I’m on call. ,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.1648358585858586,17952,

My team mostly works with Epic Caboodle (sometimes Clarity) to built reports for research and operations/quality improvement purposes.  Our developers write high-level SQL 80-90% of the day. The other time is spent on internal process improvement  building dashboards in Tableau  or working on other tools for our customers.  While I'm not an applications analyst  I can say that my job as an analyst is significantly different from our BI team. I spend maybe 5% of my time writing pretty basic SQL  and the rest of my time is spent in a project management/data consultant type role interacting with customers and shepherding their projects through the development lifecycle.  I personally think there's more room for growth and development coming from the analyst side. I can always grow my SQL skills and spend more time developing reports  but I enjoy interacting with clinicians and working with them to transform their ideas into a list of project requirements. While the skillset to be a competent BI Developer is definitely not simple  I think it's actually more difficult to be an analyst on the customer-facing side of the equation.

I'm afraid I'm somehow weakening my resume by taking a non nursing job. I could have likely tried to negotiate a higher pay  but it wasn't less than I'm making and I'm more after the experience that higher pay ATM. Also I suppose I could work a weekend here or there clinically to keep up my nursing chops.      The other option would have been to wait for volunteer projects involving informatics  jump in those if even allowed to  and then hope that was enough weight on my resume to get something better later.

This will help keep your clinical skills interest and add credibility when representing end users. Also  if the job gets boring you still have options to fall back on.  I don't think it's unreasonable to take the analyst gig. It sounds like you still need to build up a skill set and advanced degree before you can really market yourself as a clinical informatics specialist or informaticist   This opens up those opportunities. My guess is this could be a perfect job to hold while you get a master's degree either in nursing informatics or healthcare informatics. In a couple of years you'll have the experience and degree to leverage (if you go that route).   ,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.07916666666666668,17979,

If this is all a waste of time and energy that wouldn't net me any worthwhile skills  that'd be frustrating.     If taking this position would get me something of value to move forward into a Nursing Informaticist role  then I'm ok w/everything about it honestly. Again  I'm not looking at this as a move up  so much as a lateral move which would then open doors in the future I don't have open to me now.      I suppose I'd just push to get involved in as many projects as possible once I'm comfortable in order to get myself out there. But if I stay where I am now  as a procedural nurse  the chances are far less I'll run into any projects at all. I've asked and just get a sort of ""Well  if something pops up we'll email you"" but I've been in this role over a year. Despite the system transitioning to Epic currently  I haven't been asked to do anything yet. I'm also not trying to be impatient  but I'm at a point in my career where I need to make some movement.

No Epic cert is worrisome  so you'll probably just be a credentialed trainer which holds no weight outside of your org.

My experience is that we review perspective vendors compliance with HIPAA but not SOC. ,,No video,2019-03-17 11:31:17,7.0,3.0,6.0,junior_bacon_chee,Service and Organizational Control,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.0,17993,

This advice is still mostly evergreen: [https://www.quora.com/Healthcare-IT-Will-it-be-more-stable-educational-and-rewarding-to-work-for-a-hospital-IT-rather-than-for-a-vendor-Allscripts-Cerner-for-the-next-few-years](https://www.quora.com/Healthcare-IT-Will-it-be-more-stable-educational-and-rewarding-to-work-for-a-hospital-IT-rather-than-for-a-vendor-Allscripts-Cerner-for-the-next-few-years). There's a diagram in the quora post  but text below:      I've done both  and I don't think that there's one right answer to the question. Based on your wording  it seems that you have the ability and the interest to pick between both. I'll touch on the job market piece at the end  sticking more to the pros and cons of each. Hopefully this helps you pick what you find to be more exciting and in tune with what you're trying to learn.     The major difference between the vendor and hospital sides of healthcare IT is the stage in which you'll engage with a project. To illustrate this in 4 simple phases  it looks like this:     R&D>>>> New Product Work >>>>> Existing Product Work >>>>> Data Utilization  &#x200B;  Now  some organizations (Academics like Mayo  Kaiser  Marshfield) have their own R&D teams or are actively developing their own solutions. This generalization doesn't apply to those situations  as those teams function somewhat like their own vendors but have a closer relationship between the teams out on the front lines. Derive from what I mention as necessary.     As a typical vendor employee you'll spend more time developing solutions and helping customers during the initial phases of installing the software they purchased from you. The only teams that don't work on those items are support teams  which have a more limited customer engagement role and work with more customers.      **Working as a Vendor means:**     1) **You'll know a lot more about where the industry is going because you'll be closer to development.** Sales and customer requests drive R&D and you'll see it before hospitals even get to implementing the solutions years later. Your feedback and work within the company can also shape the development that customers use. It's cool to say you built something used nation or worldwide.     **2) You'll work with** ***more*** **hospitals... but in a limited capacity.** You'll get to see what many organizations are doing and you'll be able to talk with peers about what their customers are doing if your experience is limited on a certain topic. Since healthcare (and its usage of IT) changes from hospital to hospital  state to state  this will give you a wide breadth of knowledge of the industry and space.     **3) But  this means you'll be onto the next customer soon enough.** I used to joke with customers when I worked on the vendor side that I was like technology Mary Poppins. It was my job to make sure that they learned about the software they bought  how to install it successfully  and relay concerns back to R&D teams. Once they were ready to make it on their own  I would float off on my umbrella to the next site that needed my help. This means you'll likely not be fully involved in the full length of a project or in as much depth as hospital counterparts. Which means...     **Working at a Hospital means:**     **1) You can work on a large project the whole way through and in a more direct way.** You'll be the person working with the clinicians and you'll be more involved in the day to day tasks. Having started on the vendor side first  I was amazed in how tricky the day to day of being at the hospital could be. You'll know more about building tools that clinicians *love* because you'll be working with them more to build them. When I worked for the vendor  I generally cared that things got done. When I worked for the hospital  I cared more that the doctors liked what I designed for them. It's a key distinction.     **2) You'll actually be involved in using the data gathered from the Healthcare IT for good.** In my opinion  we're in the no fun part of the Healthcare IT boom times. We're spending a lot of our energy trying to get people to use the EMR that had no compelling reason to before. There are alot of things required to qualify for Meaningful Use that the average doctor doesn't care about. Doctors *like technology*. Anecdotally  75% of doctors talking about how they don't understand the EMR own iPhones. They aren't luddites. We've failed them some in designing software they like (or trying to do it on the cheap). Sometimes they fail us by not engaging us with concerns and working with us on solutions. These are the current day to day battles of healthcare IT.      But soon? We're going to be able to know so much more about medicine by querying the data created through the EMR. We'll be able to design better decision support  enhance clinic efficiency and reach patients in new compelling ways. Doctors will see technology as a tool and not a burden because it will help them better understand patients while not hampering the ""art"" part of medicine. For example  Kaiser's Dept. of Research is already seeing the ability to know more about its members/patients. If you will work at a hospital  you'll be on the front lines making sense of it all. *Isn't that awesome?!?!*     **3) But  someone might still say that your experience is limited.** One time I helped a doctor design some tools for his Ortho practice. The other doctors at his practice liked them and they drastically enhanced provider productivity (the EMR sometimes hurts productivity and everyone hears those stories  is hoped to be a wash  productivity increases are generally seen as a success). He was ok giving them to other ortho docs for free. A group of surgeons in a city down the road checked out the tools  and dismissively said ""We aren't interested  *we don't practice medicine that way.*"" And that was that  they built out something entirely new. There's no one size fits all solution in healthcare. If you start at a hospital  someone may say that your experience is limited or it may take longer to work your way up.     There are a few other smaller things that I can think of  but those are the major points. Determine which one of those sounds more exciting and educational and go that way.     **Job Market >** Healthcare IT is at the confluence of technology and healthcare  two growing fields for careers. I haven't heard much about layoffs of HIT staff  but generally people that keep industry skills are able to find new things. Even if Allscripts is purchased or Cerner sells or Epic collapses in 10-20 years  their systems and successors will still be well entrenched. Unless the scene in your city is different  I don't know if one is better than the other right now. I also don't know if it's easy to predict if one will go in the tank first.     &#x200B;",,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.2165841617230506,18003,

Hell you could go from application work into Citrix support  DBA  Infosec  web dev etc if you network well at a hospital.

I wouldn't recommend getting a degree in Health Informatics. You learn a lot of it on the floor as a bedside nurse. Your clinical experience is more valuable in the IT world. That knowledge really expands the IT world.  As far as any summer jobs  I'm a little unsure  depends on the hospital if they offer any Implementation SuperUsers. Hell  even a Helpdesk job at a Hospital would give you a leg up on any competition.  My organization is currently going through a ""realignment"" so we currently are doing ""lateral"" movements. For me  opportunities come and go. If you have a chance to assist in any project  take initiative. Be proactive. For example  if there are any opportunities to become a trainer or superuser. Take that opportunity to thoroughly know the EHR. Ask to assist in Go-Lives  this gets your feet wet in many aspects of HIT.   Becoming an RN really allows that communication line open between IT and Medical Professionals. It allows you to really understand their workflow. All and all  RNs are a major player. They understand workflow which is an ""Informaticist"" Since you understand that  you can move laterally to an analyst  then manager  or project manager therefore the foundation of understanding workflow really can move mountains in this world.

",,No video,2019-03-07 09:08:41,17.0,5.0,3.0,zytz,the best nurse informaticists i've worked with are great because they've spent some amount of time actually practicing as a nurse  and can be thought of as experts in their area.  having actually spent time in the ED/OR/ICU etc. they have firsthand experience being in those environment as well as experience with the challenges those areas face.  As someone with an academic background in Informatics I have the capacity to approach and conceptually understand any sort of problem I'm presented with in the context of the specific systems I support  but a subject matter expert in an area will have the capacity to understand these issues functionally  and provide sometimes invaluable input on why certain conceptually viable  IT solutions are not viable functionally.  Having additional informatics education is never going to be a bad thing in my opinion  however I don't feel it will be more valuable than firsthand experience.  Transition from clinical care to HIT is a common path into the field.  Informatics roles typically aren't heavily involved in development or technical support of HIT systems in my experience  but lots of former clinicians make their way into analyst roles as well  and do have jobs that are more technical in nature.  That said  generally speaking  analyst jobs aren't so technical that you should consider additional education exclusively for that role  if that's the sort of work you're interested in.  Again  it certainly won't hinder you  but I've spent plenty of time with great analysts that have 2 year nursing degrees from years ago as their only education  so its certainly not a requirement.  As far as moving up the corporate ladder  those paths are available to you as well  but exactly what your limit is with your current education is somewhat organization dependent.  For example at my org I anticipate i'll be capped at low or mid-level management or project management without further education (4 year BS  Informatics)  but a previous hospital I worked for employed a CIO with a 2-year computer science degree  so mileage certainly can vary.  As far as salaries I've only personally worked in analyst roles in a hospital so if you're interested in that path PM me- additionally my sister is a relatively new nurse and I have some insight on how she's been doing financially as well,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.08956287614824199,18054,

The best advise I can give is to keep this specialty in the back of your mind for your first 4-5 years as a bedside nurse. As others have stated  what separates a nurse in HIT from an analyst is their understanding of workflows and the needs of the ""in the trenches"" providers. You can only get that through experience at the bedside. Further  most nursing informaticists draw heavily from their bedside area of expertise and you'll be the go-to for that specialty (although you'll eventually branch out and learn nursing specialties that are outside of your comfort zone). For me as a cardiac nurse  it was pediatric oncology. I got tapped for a project and in order to be effective at understanding their needs and how to speak to them I needed to do a deep dive and learn how to be an oncology nurse first.    So while you're waiting to transition into informatics  remember to first take excellent care of your patients. Once you're comfortable managing your time and delivering good care as a new grad (about a year in)  then start trying to be the ""go-to"" for tech roll-outs on your unit and the hospital. Become a ""super user"" and network with the informaticists. We often keep an eye out for who would be a good addition to the team  and we only know that from knowing you.   Focus on being a good nurse and a positive team member and you'll be well positioned to excel in HIT. Oh  and skip the health informatics degree. I've yet to see that paper ever help anyone get a job in HIT that wasn't already going to. And conversely I've seen a number of people with it passed over for positions because they didn't have enough practical real-world experience. The adage is  you can teach a nurse to be an IT analyst  but you can't teach an IT analyst how to be a nurse.   Salary-wise  I'm in the Chicagoland area at one of the bigger organizations with 10 years under my belt (6 in HIT) and I'm at $96k.   As a nurse you can absolutely ""climb the corporate ladder"" but in my experience unless you're someone who needs to chase a title for a sense of personal pride  it's not worth it. This may not be everywhere  but at my org once you flip into the management track typically you lose the ""clinical"" prefix to your position and therefore aren't compensated in a way that reflects your license. Many of our clinical analysts (especially the senior clinical analysts) are paid more than our managers. That is of course until you get to the Director or VP level  otherwise your salary doesn't tend to pace well compared to the stress and workload. But hey  to each their own. You can also make a shitload of money as a consultant  but there are a number of cons to that as well (constant travel  unpredictability  and the market seems a little over-saturated now since there aren't as many system-wide implementations now that meaningful use has been in place for a decade now).  Summer jobs? I like the help-desk idea that someone suggested  but I'd focus on something clinical like an internship or working part-time as a CNA for a hospital system you'd like to work at. Even better if you can figure out the type of unit you'd like to start your career on (and leverage the experience from it in your informatics career). Life is all about networking  when you graduate there's literally tens of thousands of new nurses graduating with you in your state. If you've got an in because you've proven yourself to be a good member of the team  you're almost guaranteed a job.

I see myself working the bedside at least for a couple of years after graduating (dec of this year). As a nursing student  I have worked with EPIC for about 2 years now  and have been interested in how to optimize its utility.   &#x200B;  I would like a career that explores how to improve the jobs of the nurses at the bedside  and am hoping that Health IT will play a role in this aspect. I would like to learn how to analyze data in a system to see what might be working on a floor  and what might not be working so hot. However  I don't have any technological background. I don't really know much about IT  but I am eager to explore all of my options as a nurse.   &#x200B;  Of course  money plays a factor in the career I want. As a neonatal nurse practitioner  which I have mild interest in  I could clear 100K upon graduating  and probably max out at 120. However  it will take as little as 4 years after graduating to even break into that position when considering the graduate degree and required experience to get into a program.   &#x200B;  On the flip side  I've talked to nurses that have transitioned right from bedside nursing to a health IT position without any degree beyond a BSN. Of course  they are now working towards degrees in business administration or Masters in Health IT  but it wasn't required for the position. Is the compensation similar in IT? Is it more? Is it less? If I am ambitious  can I take on more roles and move up in mgmt positions? This is such a new position it seems  that I can not find much relevant information. ,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.20269708361813624,18059,

Specialists usually mean that they have an EHR that fits the specialty. they give records pretty simple.  What I burned to CD was a combination of Documents in jpeg and HTML.  You would open the folder on the cd and there is a single HTML file that you open and it contains a frontend to your records. Click on a section and then click on the record and it opens in the browser and you can do with it from there what you want.  Being Specialties they are smaller EHR market so they are really no frills. Not all are that way.   All the documents and the XML files are in a hidden folder.  This is how one specialty that I am familiar with has it.  Because of HIPAA you will receive electronic files that can be ran on any computer. Has to be. CD or on a USB stick.  They will not use your USB stick. Too much a HIPAA risk if they are doing it right.  ,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.05077838827838828,18106,

I'm much more of a 'people person'  so helping clinicians in person feels much more gratifying  and the impact is immediate and tangible. In terms of the bigger picture  training is incredibly underrated--I started doing it because literally 90+% of complaints and issues I was hearing from clinicians were things the system was set up to do perfectly well  but that they were never taught. The best designed and built software in the world is worthless if users can't use it well.

On one side you have informational sciences  on the other  you have the targeted ""domain""  [the intersection is the ""domain"" informatics](http://jamia.oxfordjournals.org/content/jaminfo/20/2/224.full.pdf).  What you have to realize is that the are multiple informatics  there is clinical  bioinformatics  public health informatics  consumer health informatics  clinical research informatics. Informatics isn't even restricted to health  there is legal informatics  cheminformatics  and others. What we are doing is looking at our tool chest of information science and pull out tools relevant to questions we want to answer or address. So  kind of like a garage  the tools there are common tools you would pull out to work on a car or truck  which you might not if you were working on a boat or refrigerator. That means when we are deploying CS to help us understand molecular biology and DNA  we are working in bioinformatics. We move up the scale and start to look at whole individuals and not cells  we are now working in clinical or health informatics (the terms are pretty interchangeable). If we shift from individuals to populations as our domain focus  we are now working in public health informatics. Informatics is really the specialization about performing analysis and building the tools for analysis.  Information technology is more about how to set up and manage the technology. I explain it that you would want someone in IT to build and maintain a database  but the informatics specialist is the one who would use the data stored in the database to seek answer to questions (performing data mining  or running a statistical analysis on the data). You don't have to be a clinician to work in informatics  but it helps to have a good understanding of the domain.  Someone trained in clinical informatics will have training on project management  statistical software (R  or SPSS)  SQL  and perhaps some training in standards (HL7  SNOMED  LOINC). An IT specialist will have more specific training in certifications (CompTIA A+  CCNA  MCSE) and their knowledge base is deeply rooted in knowing a system or software (powershell  active directory).",,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.12061403508771927,18166,

I think most organizations of that size just don't do enough integration work to get attention from those vendors. We have a lot of projects that kick off and take awhile to complete.      The most common piece of data integration advice that I like to give people is that you can probably hire 1/2 of a Medical Assistant FTE for around $15-20K most places in America. If your app integration is not facilitating a better workflow than hiring a person who can enter data between your app and an EHR  then you should just tell them to hire the MA.      There are exceptions to this  of course. Large scale integrations can save multiple FTEs worth of time. Integrations that grow revenue pay for themselves. Integrations that reduce the risk of adverse events by reducing double documentation don't harm patients (which other than being empirically good  pays for itself). But  it's otherwise really difficult. There's a reason why most healthcare organizations that sell integrated products focus on what Epic referred to as the ""Whales and academic medical centers""... they have the sophistication to deliver a product as needed.

Eg. Amazon’s echo products in the home for patient data collection  Google’s search profiles for patient data collection  etc.  Re: the db question  I think it’s not just about the technology  but also about ownership.  I believe Apple is more about bringing the ownership of the patient record back to the individual patient  and away from the providers and payers  and this obviously conflicts with Epic’s business model.  I don’t care for the hype that Cramer is discussing  esp. when he’s concerned with “perception” and how that affects stock valuations.  To that degree  I like the Epic CEO’s gumption to stick with her intentions to maintain a socially responsible organization  esp. to the providers that depend on her product. ,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.1916666666666667,18205,

That could mean a lot of things. It's also worth noting that ""cloud databases"" can mean a lot of things  from hosted DBs to DB as a service. I can imagine a few things that might be a challenge:  1. I doubt any cloud provider has support specifically for Caché aka M aka MUMPS databases. So if you want to do anything specific to the DB you're probably out of luck.  2. Cloud offerings can be expensive per GB of storage (or GB of RAM  or processor time) because you're not just buying the hardware  you're paying for the management. This can be a really good deal for some companies that need flexibility or that don't want to pay to set up their own IT infrastructure.

I haven’t seen their MyChart  so I can’t speak to that.

I used to work at Methodist hospital (part of IU health) in the first few years of my pharmacy career and they are a Cerner shop. At that time  10 years ago  there was absolutely nothing from Cerner that I ever saw for patients. That’s great to hear you’re serving the patients in Indianapolis with that sort of assistance! It’s so complicated  I can say it’s even been a challenge for my family and I’m a pharmacist in health care informatics!  I am encouraged that Epic is trying to make a better experience for patients  but I’m skeptical that they want to empower patients and give them agency of their own health records  if they aren’t moving interoperability forward. The impression I have  is that they want to be the sole EHR vendor of the world.

Or at least support just isn't for you?  From my experience  I wouldn't be able to find employment without working for a health system - industry is still trending towards individual hospitals being acquired by larger networks  and existing networks growing so as to not be acquired by larger networks.  Regarding printers  i agree they're the most reprehensible  dumb machines on the planet  but there's lots of different flavors of printing support.  The printing I configure and support in Epic is actually really straightforward and easy to understand from an application side  and there's usually a very clear line between configuration problems in the software vs. the device.

Some may flop  but some may revolutionize how patients are cared for - and in the end it's all about the patients (and the clinicians who are caring for them). Career-wise I've been able to present at conferences for some of the projects I've worked on because we did it first. That's invaluable on a resume.  Also  I've worked in both Cerner and Epic shops.

Do not go into nursing unless you want to be a nurse first and foremost. Yes  you can shift to informatics  but it isn't going to make you good at it just because you have your RN  BSN  or even your MSN. What makes you good at it is experience as a bedside nurse. You need to understand the workflows  thought processes  and the how and why clinicians are asking for what they are asking. You need to be anticipating the clinician's needs that they are not asking for and the unintended consequences of what they are asking for. Additionally  most health IT jobs will not hire you without at least 2 but usually >5 years of bedside.  If you're not a nurse for the right reason  you'll be miserable for those 2-5 years and do your patients a disservice.   This is the same thing I tell people who are interested in getting into nursing because it's steady work and a paycheck that put you solidly in the middle class.

Having landed roles with top health tech companies over the last several years (although I still have a lot to learn)  I wanted to share some insights that I am hoping will help others on their journey. The more intelligent  passionate people we have working to solve the inherent challenges of healthcare  the more impact we can have together.

902,r1ker,[david byrne] well  how did i get here?,hey there r/healthIT! my name is cam and i've worked in the health IT field for  more or less  two years. i wanted to share with you my journey for anyone considering this field and lost on where exactly to start.   i was first an accountancy major at a major southeastern university and after four semesters of a grueling workload  a serious case of homesickness  and turmoil over owing my school $25 000 already in student loans  i transferred into the health informatics and information management program at a local hospital. i was excited because the program was 100% online  i could work and go to school  and the class size was amazingly small. i think my biggest class had  like  ten people. sounded good.   until i was tortured within an inch of my life by droning online lectures  instructors who were scrutinizing to the point of anally directing a largely confused body of students  and my dad's retirement from his breadwinner job didn't help my cause either. this past summer i really was at an impasse. fortunately my area's community college offered a two-year's associate in health information technology and i leapt at the chance to join. immediately i was accepted and got down to business completing pre-requisites like medical terminology.   i won't lie  most of my immediate family is more or less steeped in that old-timey religion of healthcare work. i've had terminology thrown around left and right just by asking my sister - a medical reconciliation nurse - about her days at work. when i was younger  five or six  i wanted to be a neonatologist  a desire fueled by my love for children and taking care of babies  be they cousins or ones of family friends.   in my time with the teaching hospital i got a wonderful job as a student researcher for my state cancer registry. this was a turning point in my outlook on my education and job prospects. the tasks themselves looked daunting when i reported for duty.   my office was the hub of activity of the whole registry  filled with printers and copiers and fax machines  and a lone computer on an L-shaped desk designed for me to toil. behind and around me were eight enormous file shelves loaded end to end with past and present pathology  cytology  x-ray  mammogram  and ultrasound reports of any and all cancer cases reported to the registry between the years 1996-2017. some were so blurry i had to strain to make out a patient name or provider  some faded triplicate from well before i myself was born  others from facilities that had been rendered defunct decades ago. still  this would become my magnum opus.   i started at one end - reorganizing the current reports for cancer cases by pathology provider  facility  practitioner  or geographical region if it was a county hospital reporting the case - and worked to the other. i also had new records to scan from existing patients whose encounters related to cancer were reported to us just for the purpose of keeping up with their treatment  they may not have had any new malignancy reported.   during my first few months of work i helped the registry director and head IT registrar with a geocoding activity meant to report patient addresses securely to the state health department and CDC. basically  what your street address is on google maps or apple maps is not really where you live. rather it's ten or twenty feet off from where your actual homestead begins; using registry software  the USPS database  and an excel spreadsheet giving patient addresses in coordinates  i helped fix about five hundred addresses so that every county in my state could have more accurate reporting numbers for their occurrences of cancer.   i made amazing friends at my time in the registry too. many have served as excellent references on my job inquiries post-research job. most hadn't begun in the industry to begin with but once they were properly trained they took to it like a duck to water  and enjoyed the case load and steady line of work. i couldn't blame them. i like this field because i'm always busy  work of fascinating stuff.   my last endeavor  and perhaps the one that stings the most because i was absolutely crushed when i was let go  was directing medical records for a large OB/GYN practice. a friend of a friend let me know their current director was on the outs  retiring finally  and that the spot was up for grabs. i practically broke my neck at a chance to get the job and just after one look at me i was brought on!  my work began in december. at the time the practice was in the works of splitting - three of its seven providers were departing to start their own practice  a move i can elaborate on simply because of its dubious nature  but that's neither here nor there - so the place was a bit of an on-fire garbage can.   every morning i made it in  punched the time clock  and checked the Fax Machine God - long may it reign - for any incoming correspondence for the doctors and nurses. these were usually refill requests  referrals from ER's or other clinics  medical record releases (for me)  and PA's needed for refills. head back to my little cubbyhole of an office  sort the documents by doctor or NP  and scan the ones who liked their copies in digital and sent to them via the EMR.   make my rounds about 9am or so and deliver the faxes  as well as pick up any documents from the previous day to scan into the patient records in the EMR  greenway. schmooze with the doctors and nurses  BS with the ladies in mammogram  refill my coffee  rinse and repeat until clock out at 4:30pm.   i can't begin to explain to you how much i loved that job. my coworkers liked me  and i them  and i loved the challenges i often faced in my work. however  i had some qualms about how we were handling patient records that were in the process of being released. y'all are probably most aware of medical records being released from your hospital or clinic by the HIM department  usually for a small fee  and you can get them in an email  faxed to the official of your choice  or even mailed.  we had thoroughly fucked our release process earlier that fall  when we partnered with a third-party outfit to send our records request to them via the EMR. seems more time-savvy  right? it was a fucking nightmare. they took about seven to ten business days when it was all said and done to collate the records and send them out to wherever the patient requested  and four times during my tenure  they sent us OUR OWN RECORDS. i hated it  and wasted no time in expressing my dissatisfaction with it to the right folks in the business office.   so  fast-forward to last tuesday  and i'm ousted because the 65-year-old crow who'd been training me to follow her won't fucking retire. i'm pissy about it but still on the prowl for a job where i can show all that i've learned. ,,No video,2019-02-14 08:11:48,0.0,0.0,6.0,,,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.0,18320,0.567

919,jamescurtis29,London event for volunteer tech developers to meet health organisations - 21st Feb,Hello all   I’m one of the organisers of a new volunteer-led group called [Radical Engineers](https://radicalengineers.com/). We connect technologists who have some time on their hands to organisations and projects that are doing hugely important things with very little resources. On 21st Feb  we will be focussing specifically on health. How can we ensure everyone has access to affordable healthcare? How do we encourage healthy lifestyles? Many radical initiatives are working to tackle these problems and some need help.  If you're interested and want to spend an evening in London meeting people and organisations who are seeking answers to these questions  [please register for our meetup](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/heal-the-world-radical-health-meetup-tickets-55868054856)!  Alternatively  if you run a health organisation which is doing something pretty radical and wish to meet engineers of all stripes (hackers  makers  designers and other technologists) who wish to contribute their spare time and talents to these projects  [please feel free to get in contact](mailto:info@radicalengineers.com).  Thank you for your attention.  Moderators  I hope it's ok that I'm posting this here as it's a non-commercial post about a free event about the intersect of health and technology.
