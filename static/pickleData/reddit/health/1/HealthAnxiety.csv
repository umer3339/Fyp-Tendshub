0,nathan98900,Think Before You Post: why reassurance seeking might be feeding your health anxiety.,Hey /r/healthanxiety    Just thought I'd make a post detailing my personal experience and knowledge about reassurance seeking and why it is self destructive.   So  you're experiencing your symptom that you're increasingly more worried about. Whether that be chest pains  heart palpitations  stomach problems  poop problems  any of the hundreds of symptoms any of us could possibly be worried about.   You're worried about if this is the time where your worrying is justified  or if it is actually a sign of the illness you're fearing.  Maybe you've already been to the doctor to get checked out  but doubt their opinion.  All of these have happened to me  and happen to many many other HA sufferers  which is completely okay.   **However**  the way you deal with it is paramount to your recovery.  Usually  what I would do  is post here  explaining my symptoms and what I was worried it was. Then I'd get some replies reassuring me and maybe feel better for a bit. Or I'd ask a close friend or family member and get the same results.  All of this felt like what I had to do  a huge compulsion to do this just to know that I was fine.   In the short term  yes  it made me feel better but this was only short lived.  This might also account for medical tests  I've spoken to many people who have previously thought that getting that MRI or CT  colonoscopy or endoscopy  or whatever it might be  would make all their worries go away. Which  after the short term relief  the anxiety came back. This is so important to understand and grasp to begin recovering from health anxiety; I speak from experience.  One of the biggest things in recovery is how you deal with these thoughts and need for reassurance. Possibly even the key to fixing your health anxiety.  So  if you don't seek that reassurance  what's going to happen? For me  at first  it was unbareable anxiety  and just an extreme desire to check I was okay  whether that was through posting to the subreddit  the discord  asking family  checking my body for lumps  checking my lymph nodes etc.   You'll most likely experience increased anxiety whilst not seeking the reassurance you want  which is completely okay. Rather than seeking reassurance  do something mindful  something genuinely healthy for the mind. As  when in a very high anxiety situation  sometimes it's the things that you do during that time that really define how your mental wellbeing will go in the future.   You can do many things  for me  it was taking myself away from what I was doing and spending 10 minutes trying to immerse or distract myself within something else  not an easy task by any means  but something to try. After the 10 minutes was up I would come back to what I was doing and try to revert my thoughts away from my worry  which most times the anxiety had passed and I didn't need to seek further reassurance.   You could possibly try meditation  though  if you don't regularly practice it  it'll be very difficult to do under high anxiety levels.   You could try relaxing music  your favourite food  anything else that enhances your mood  whatever works for you.   During this time  you will experience anxiety  potentially more during that time of not seeking the reassurance  but I promise you  in the long run it is going to do wonderful things compared to getting the reassurance and feeding the problem.  When you seek reassurance  you're reinforcing the behaviours which keep your health anxiety alive unfortunately  because usually it feels like the right thing  and the only thing to do in that situation. But trust me  try not seeking it.  It'll be very similar to [this graph](https://thegirlwiththecurlyhair.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/anxiety-repeated-exposure-graph.png)  the more you do it the easier it'll be. And it might get to the point where the anxiety almost completely goes after a while of practicing this.   Seriously  it is worth definitely giving a go and thinking about this if you're currently having a lot of anxiety  I've been there hundreds of times  and applying this mentality was one of the key turning points into recovering from health anxiety.        ,self,No video,2018-02-03 10:59:55,44.0,198.0,0.0,Ionlyused59,Yessss..I couldn't agree with this more. We seek reassurance and we often don't realize it's such an OCD tendency and asking likely isn't going to help us anyway.  Because next day  next week we will be fearful of some thing else. The therapist I used to see said asking for reassurance is like my drug.

Working through the sudden occurence of intense heart palpitations and managing the anxiety throughout was a breakthrough for me in some ways.  We are all going to die; we are all going to have health issues at some point (probably  unless something traumatic happens)  so thinking about my future and how I will stay sane and strong mentally as age adds little aches and pains (and heart palpitations  in my case) is very important.   Great to see those who feel cured. I have long periods (6 months  often) with little issues at all  but then a cramping will slowly start a new bout of it. Reassurance-seeking is almost always the fertilizer on this seed of concern.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.20968805704099824,16214,

I started therapy last week  have another session in two days  and am really hopeful. I mentioned at my last session that reassurance seeking was something that not only raised my own anxiety levels by a lot  but I've been exhausting my doctors  family  friends  etc. I've been going through some health issues lately and am having surgery this week  so ever since  every new symptom (no matter how new or unrelated to what I'm being treated for) sends me off the deep-end. It causes that nauseating spiral of ""but what if this is IT this time?"" I think it's worth mentioning that when you're forced not to think about whatever symptoms you're experiencing at the moment (such as being at work  school  social gathering)  a lot of symptoms disappear. But shortly thereafter it's back to focusing on another new symptom. A personal issue with health anxiety that I have is also looking into all my lab/test results and ""finding"" things that my trained  experienced doctors might have ""missed."" You begin to play doctor with no credentials  you use Google as your basis of research  and your symptoms ""explain"" your diagnosis. Health anxiety is no joke  and this is a great post about one of the many self-defeating aspects on the road to recovery.

Bottom line  we are not alone.  I am convinced that I have a real serious illness and will try not to mention it. Four weeks ago I was convinced that I got the pancreatic one.... then I went through studies and found out that I was wrong. So  I was convinced then that it was in reality esophagus.... ups  studies after I was wrong again. Two weeks ago I started having some pain while peeing... yes  you got it... prostatic!! Wrong again. This week? Testicular.  But today I decided to stop it. I won’t go to the doctor and will leave it as it is. It is really hard not to even google my symptoms but I need to end this.  My psychologist says that this is the way my mind avoids thinking on the real things I should be worried about. I recommend reading The power of now from Eckhart Tolle.

You can do many things  for me  it was taking myself away from what I was doing and spending 10 minutes trying to immerse or distract myself within something else  not an easy task by any means  but something to try. After the 10 minutes was up I would come back to what I was doing and try to revert my thoughts away from my worry  which most times the anxiety had passed and I didn't need to seek further reassurance.   You could possibly try meditation  though  if you don't regularly practice it  it'll be very difficult to do under high anxiety levels.   You could try relaxing music  your favourite food  anything else that enhances your mood  whatever works for you.   During this time  you will experience anxiety  potentially more during that time of not seeking the reassurance  but I promise you  in the long run it is going to do wonderful things compared to getting the reassurance and feeding the problem.  When you seek reassurance  you're reinforcing the behaviours which keep your health anxiety alive unfortunately  because usually it feels like the right thing  and the only thing to do in that situation.

For those of us who experience panic attacks or anything related to our heart/breathing  it can be terrifying and you begin to think  yeah okay the doctors say I’m healthy (other than anxiety) but what if I’m actually in danger this time?  This often causes me to spiral during panic attacks and leads to more anxiety.

7,nathan98900,Think Before You Post: why reassurance seeking might be feeding your health anxiety.,Hey /r/healthanxiety    Just thought I'd make a post detailing my personal experience and knowledge about reassurance seeking and why it is self destructive.   So  you're experiencing your symptom that you're increasingly more worried about. Whether that be chest pains  heart palpitations  stomach problems  poop problems  any of the hundreds of symptoms any of us could possibly be worried about.   You're worried about if this is the time where your worrying is justified  or if it is actually a sign of the illness you're fearing.  Maybe you've already been to the doctor to get checked out  but doubt their opinion.  All of these have happened to me  and happen to many many other HA sufferers  which is completely okay.   **However**  the way you deal with it is paramount to your recovery.  Usually  what I would do  is post here  explaining my symptoms and what I was worried it was. Then I'd get some replies reassuring me and maybe feel better for a bit. Or I'd ask a close friend or family member and get the same results.  All of this felt like what I had to do  a huge compulsion to do this just to know that I was fine.   In the short term  yes  it made me feel better but this was only short lived.  This might also account for medical tests  I've spoken to many people who have previously thought that getting that MRI or CT  colonoscopy or endoscopy  or whatever it might be  would make all their worries go away. Which  after the short term relief  the anxiety came back. This is so important to understand and grasp to begin recovering from health anxiety; I speak from experience.  One of the biggest things in recovery is how you deal with these thoughts and need for reassurance. Possibly even the key to fixing your health anxiety.  So  if you don't seek that reassurance  what's going to happen?

I’m not sure how to apply this to my food anxiety but I definitely will try it with my health anxiety. I have major compulsions to seek reassurance during times of anxiety  especially with my heart and breathing  but I’m going to try super hard to implement what you’ve suggested because seeking reassurance and consequently feeding the anxiety clearly doesn’t help so there’s nothing to lose! Thank you again ☺️ I wish you a happy and peaceful mind ,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.08218005952380952,16220,

I've had HA for a little over a year  and I've recently learned to just forget about everything  and let it go through its natural motions. Pain in your neck? Good. Let it be there. It'll go away in a few days most likely. Resist driving yourself to the ER or scheduling a doctor's appointment  and you'll force your mind to realize that it's nothing serious.   It's so nice that things like this are out there that were never a thing back before the internet. I would have had no way to even begin to tackle HA if it wasn't for the internet. ,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.17992424242424246,16221,

All of these have happened to me  and happen to many many other HA sufferers  which is completely okay.   **However**  the way you deal with it is paramount to your recovery.  Usually  what I would do  is post here  explaining my symptoms and what I was worried it was. Then I'd get some replies reassuring me and maybe feel better for a bit. Or I'd ask a close friend or family member and get the same results.  All of this felt like what I had to do  a huge compulsion to do this just to know that I was fine.   In the short term  yes  it made me feel better but this was only short lived.  This might also account for medical tests  I've spoken to many people who have previously thought that getting that MRI or CT  colonoscopy or endoscopy  or whatever it might be  would make all their worries go away. Which  after the short term relief  the anxiety came back. This is so important to understand and grasp to begin recovering from health anxiety; I speak from experience.  One of the biggest things in recovery is how you deal with these thoughts and need for reassurance. Possibly even the key to fixing your health anxiety.  So  if you don't seek that reassurance  what's going to happen? For me  at first  it was unbareable anxiety  and just an extreme desire to check I was okay  whether that was through posting to the subreddit  the discord  asking family  checking my body for lumps  checking my lymph nodes etc.   You'll most likely experience increased anxiety whilst not seeking the reassurance you want  which is completely okay. Rather than seeking reassurance  do something mindful  something genuinely healthy for the mind. As  when in a very high anxiety situation  sometimes it's the things that you do during that time that really define how your mental wellbeing will go in the future.   You can do many things  for me  it was taking myself away from what I was doing and spending 10 minutes trying to immerse or distract myself within something else  not an easy task by any means  but something to try. After the 10 minutes was up I would come back to what I was doing and try to revert my thoughts away from my worry  which most times the anxiety had passed and I didn't need to seek further reassurance.   You could possibly try meditation  though  if you don't regularly practice it  it'll be very difficult to do under high anxiety levels.   You could try relaxing music  your favourite food  anything else that enhances your mood  whatever works for you.   During this time  you will experience anxiety  potentially more during that time of not seeking the reassurance  but I promise you  in the long run it is going to do wonderful things compared to getting the reassurance and feeding the problem.  When you seek reassurance  you're reinforcing the behaviours which keep your health anxiety alive unfortunately  because usually it feels like the right thing  and the only thing to do in that situation. But trust me  try not seeking it.  It'll be very similar to [this graph](https://thegirlwiththecurlyhair.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/anxiety-repeated-exposure-graph.png)  the more you do it the easier it'll be. And it might get to the point where the anxiety almost completely goes after a while of practicing this.   Seriously  it is worth definitely giving a go and thinking about this if you're currently having a lot of anxiety  I've been there hundreds of times  and applying this mentality was one of the key turning points into recovering from health anxiety.        ,self,No video,2018-02-03 10:59:55,44.0,198.0,13.0,scntgy,thank you!

At the same time  i don't know why  but i want an official diagnosis and to start on the path to tackling my mental illness  not being scared by it.   i wrote about my fear of diagnosis and healthcare professionals here [https://www.psychologicalthinking.com/articles-1/is-it-welcomed-or-feared-diagnosis](https://www.psychologicalthinking.com/articles-1/is-it-welcomed-or-feared-diagnosis) and explored why others sometimes turn their backs on their healthcare systems. Reading some of the other comments has made me realise that another reason many people might have health anxiety is because they can't relate to the practitioners in front of them  so distrust them. I also wrote about disfranchised groups in healthcare here  geared towards counselling and therapy  [https://www.psychologicalthinking.com/articles-1/are-counselling-and-therapy-failing-marginalised-groups](https://www.psychologicalthinking.com/articles-1/are-counselling-and-therapy-failing-marginalised-groups),,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",-0.013636363636363618,16227,

My problem is I don't find it easy to trust gps because I have a disability    gps and specialists can get it wrong.

20,nathan98900,Think Before You Post: why reassurance seeking might be feeding your health anxiety.,Hey /r/healthanxiety    Just thought I'd make a post detailing my personal experience and knowledge about reassurance seeking and why it is self destructive.   So  you're experiencing your symptom that you're increasingly more worried about. Whether that be chest pains  heart palpitations  stomach problems  poop problems  any of the hundreds of symptoms any of us could possibly be worried about.   You're worried about if this is the time where your worrying is justified  or if it is actually a sign of the illness you're fearing.  Maybe you've already been to the doctor to get checked out  but doubt their opinion.  All of these have happened to me  and happen to many many other HA sufferers  which is completely okay.   **However**  the way you deal with it is paramount to your recovery.  Usually  what I would do  is post here  explaining my symptoms and what I was worried it was. Then I'd get some replies reassuring me and maybe feel better for a bit. Or I'd ask a close friend or family member and get the same results.  All of this felt like what I had to do  a huge compulsion to do this just to know that I was fine.   In the short term  yes  it made me feel better but this was only short lived.  This might also account for medical tests  I've spoken to many people who have previously thought that getting that MRI or CT  colonoscopy or endoscopy  or whatever it might be  would make all their worries go away. Which  after the short term relief  the anxiety came back. This is so important to understand and grasp to begin recovering from health anxiety; I speak from experience.  One of the biggest things in recovery is how you deal with these thoughts and need for reassurance. Possibly even the key to fixing your health anxiety.  So  if you don't seek that reassurance  what's going to happen? For me  at first  it was unbareable anxiety  and just an extreme desire to check I was okay  whether that was through posting to the subreddit  the discord  asking family  checking my body for lumps  checking my lymph nodes etc.   You'll most likely experience increased anxiety whilst not seeking the reassurance you want  which is completely okay. Rather than seeking reassurance  do something mindful  something genuinely healthy for the mind. As  when in a very high anxiety situation  sometimes it's the things that you do during that time that really define how your mental wellbeing will go in the future.   You can do many things  for me  it was taking myself away from what I was doing and spending 10 minutes trying to immerse or distract myself within something else  not an easy task by any means  but something to try. After the 10 minutes was up I would come back to what I was doing and try to revert my thoughts away from my worry  which most times the anxiety had passed and I didn't need to seek further reassurance.   You could possibly try meditation  though  if you don't regularly practice it  it'll be very difficult to do under high anxiety levels.   You could try relaxing music  your favourite food  anything else that enhances your mood  whatever works for you.   During this time  you will experience anxiety  potentially more during that time of not seeking the reassurance  but I promise you  in the long run it is going to do wonderful things compared to getting the reassurance and feeding the problem.

27,nathan98900,Think Before You Post: why reassurance seeking might be feeding your health anxiety.,Hey /r/healthanxiety    Just thought I'd make a post detailing my personal experience and knowledge about reassurance seeking and why it is self destructive.   So  you're experiencing your symptom that you're increasingly more worried about. Whether that be chest pains  heart palpitations  stomach problems  poop problems  any of the hundreds of symptoms any of us could possibly be worried about.   You're worried about if this is the time where your worrying is justified  or if it is actually a sign of the illness you're fearing.  Maybe you've already been to the doctor to get checked out  but doubt their opinion.  All of these have happened to me  and happen to many many other HA sufferers  which is completely okay.   **However**  the way you deal with it is paramount to your recovery.  Usually  what I would do  is post here  explaining my symptoms and what I was worried it was. Then I'd get some replies reassuring me and maybe feel better for a bit. Or I'd ask a close friend or family member and get the same results.  All of this felt like what I had to do  a huge compulsion to do this just to know that I was fine.   In the short term  yes  it made me feel better but this was only short lived.  This might also account for medical tests  I've spoken to many people who have previously thought that getting that MRI or CT  colonoscopy or endoscopy  or whatever it might be  would make all their worries go away. Which  after the short term relief  the anxiety came back. This is so important to understand and grasp to begin recovering from health anxiety; I speak from experience.  One of the biggest things in recovery is how you deal with these thoughts and need for reassurance. Possibly even the key to fixing your health anxiety.  So  if you don't seek that reassurance  what's going to happen? For me  at first  it was unbareable anxiety  and just an extreme desire to check I was okay  whether that was through posting to the subreddit  the discord  asking family  checking my body for lumps  checking my lymph nodes etc.   You'll most likely experience increased anxiety whilst not seeking the reassurance you want  which is completely okay. Rather than seeking reassurance  do something mindful  something genuinely healthy for the mind. As  when in a very high anxiety situation  sometimes it's the things that you do during that time that really define how your mental wellbeing will go in the future.   You can do many things  for me  it was taking myself away from what I was doing and spending 10 minutes trying to immerse or distract myself within something else  not an easy task by any means  but something to try. After the 10 minutes was up I would come back to what I was doing and try to revert my thoughts away from my worry  which most times the anxiety had passed and I didn't need to seek further reassurance.   You could possibly try meditation  though  if you don't regularly practice it  it'll be very difficult to do under high anxiety levels.

Sorry to hear you’ve been battling it for so long. Knowing I can beat it for significant chunks of time is great respite and confidence to lean into. The question for me used to constantly be “will this be the rest of my life!?”  which would just exacerbate the issue. Learning to realize that it *might* be  but even if so it’ll be a series of ups and downs rather than just one long down was really useful.  At this point I’ve kind of accepted that most people will never experience anxiety in their most extreme points like I experience on a fairly regular basis. That’s intense in one perspective but also liberating in another. I feel like I’ve probably summited 100x the mental battles of most people and when a real threat does come along (I.e. something that’s actually worried about by most people)  I’m able to keep it together better - it’s basically practice vs. torture if you flip the script.  Idk  looking for “the answer” didn’t pan out for me. It still might  but learning to just take the punch and roll with it rather than just focusing on the pain of the impact was really useful.   EDIT: Though I do hope you got a good doc to look at you? I have palpitations every day and it was a similar phase of extreme fear and then acceptance. I have them right now and a year ago I would’ve tensed up and my night would’ve become a series of focusing on them. I never would’ve believed then that I would experience the same severity a year later and be fine about it and usually not even notice (I had lots of respite  of course - it’s not like it was nonstop  even though for the first few weeks it definitely seemed like it was).   Having an electrophysiologist give me a full workup was absolutely necessary  even though it didn’t cure me in the least at first. Eventually things calmed down and I could sort of relax into the knowledge that when it came back  it was nothing new.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.15645659250310412,16242,

All of these have happened to me  and happen to many many other HA sufferers  which is completely okay.   **However**  the way you deal with it is paramount to your recovery.  Usually  what I would do  is post here  explaining my symptoms and what I was worried it was. Then I'd get some replies reassuring me and maybe feel better for a bit. Or I'd ask a close friend or family member and get the same results.  All of this felt like what I had to do  a huge compulsion to do this just to know that I was fine.   In the short term  yes  it made me feel better but this was only short lived.  This might also account for medical tests  I've spoken to many people who have previously thought that getting that MRI or CT  colonoscopy or endoscopy  or whatever it might be  would make all their worries go away. Which  after the short term relief  the anxiety came back. This is so important to understand and grasp to begin recovering from health anxiety; I speak from experience.  One of the biggest things in recovery is how you deal with these thoughts and need for reassurance. Possibly even the key to fixing your health anxiety.  So  if you don't seek that reassurance  what's going to happen? For me  at first  it was unbareable anxiety  and just an extreme desire to check I was okay  whether that was through posting to the subreddit  the discord  asking family  checking my body for lumps  checking my lymph nodes etc.   You'll most likely experience increased anxiety whilst not seeking the reassurance you want  which is completely okay. Rather than seeking reassurance  do something mindful  something genuinely healthy for the mind. As  when in a very high anxiety situation  sometimes it's the things that you do during that time that really define how your mental wellbeing will go in the future.   You can do many things  for me  it was taking myself away from what I was doing and spending 10 minutes trying to immerse or distract myself within something else  not an easy task by any means  but something to try. After the 10 minutes was up I would come back to what I was doing and try to revert my thoughts away from my worry  which most times the anxiety had passed and I didn't need to seek further reassurance.   You could possibly try meditation  though  if you don't regularly practice it  it'll be very difficult to do under high anxiety levels.   You could try relaxing music  your favourite food  anything else that enhances your mood  whatever works for you.   During this time  you will experience anxiety  potentially more during that time of not seeking the reassurance  but I promise you  in the long run it is going to do wonderful things compared to getting the reassurance and feeding the problem.  When you seek reassurance  you're reinforcing the behaviours which keep your health anxiety alive unfortunately  because usually it feels like the right thing  and the only thing to do in that situation. But trust me  try not seeking it.  It'll be very similar to [this graph](https://thegirlwiththecurlyhair.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/anxiety-repeated-exposure-graph.png)  the more you do it the easier it'll be. And it might get to the point where the anxiety almost completely goes after a while of practicing this.   Seriously  it is worth definitely giving a go and thinking about this if you're currently having a lot of anxiety  I've been there hundreds of times  and applying this mentality was one of the key turning points into recovering from health anxiety.        ,self,No video,2018-02-03 10:59:55,44.0,198.0,33.0,Dootietree,I think you may have hit the heart of my problem with HA. Though not debilitating and really in it's infancy for me  I can tell the reassurance and Dr visits  tests...etc. Won't do anything long term. Especially if my symptoms don't go away (abdominal soreness/change in bowels movements).   So long as I'm feeling the abdominal discomfort I'll have questioning thoughts.   And the truth is doctors miss stuff. They get it wrong. It's not 100%. Especially with the stuff I'm worried about. Truth is they could run all the tests and be wrong. It's happened. I've read the stories.   I think it's ultimately just a decision to accept whatever may cone. To enjoy the days you can enjoy. Why suffer before you suffer if that makes sense...  I think a fear of death and suffering is a big part of it. Thing is it may coming for anyone. No one knows. That's the hardest part to me. Just waiting on the big event  the big news  the call  the diagnosis  the accident...  But to live each day as it comes and not worry about tomorrow  because worrying accomplishes nothing...to get to that point. I guess that's the goal.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.002597402597402606,16246,

How about getting a wristband that records your pulse for the day  but set a rule where you look at the results at a set time each evening?  Even at the peak anxiety refuse to look or paint over the display.   Then later you can approach the information from a detached viewpoint and let you be objective.

How random  I never thought anyone else had the fears I had! And you know it’s super far fetched and ridiculous but you just can’t help but obsess over it ugh. I don’t know if this will help you but it helped me during one of my biggest paranoia flares with having my food poisoned or like for example getting a bad can of food at the supermarket- I wrote down every single thing I consumed in a notebook for a few days or weeks and looked back on everything having not reacted badly to anything and tried to rationalise my thoughts that way. Also it got to a point where I’d prepare food myself and still not eat it because I thought somewhere along the line something could’ve been badly contaminated. I also would eat some food then wait 30-90 mins before eating the rest of it to see if it was drugged/I was allergic and I felt any bad effects and stuff. I’m really glad to know I’m not alone and I hope maybe if you try the tip that it helps you even the slightest bit :),,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",-0.1334656084656084,16252,
40,xereeto,Health Anxiety Starter Pack,Hey /r/healthanxiety    Just thought I'd make a post detailing my personal experience and knowledge about reassurance seeking and why it is self destructive.   So  you're experiencing your symptom that you're increasingly more worried about. Whether that be chest pains  heart palpitations  stomach problems  poop problems  any of the hundreds of symptoms any of us could possibly be worried about.   You're worried about if this is the time where your worrying is justified  or if it is actually a sign of the illness you're fearing.  Maybe you've already been to the doctor to get checked out  but doubt their opinion.  All of these have happened to me  and happen to many many other HA sufferers  which is completely okay.   **However**  the way you deal with it is paramount to your recovery.  Usually  what I would do  is post here  explaining my symptoms and what I was worried it was. Then I'd get some replies reassuring me and maybe feel better for a bit. Or I'd ask a close friend or family member and get the same results.  All of this felt like what I had to do  a huge compulsion to do this just to know that I was fine.   In the short term  yes  it made me feel better but this was only short lived.  This might also account for medical tests  I've spoken to many people who have previously thought that getting that MRI or CT  colonoscopy or endoscopy  or whatever it might be  would make all their worries go away. Which  after the short term relief  the anxiety came back. This is so important to understand and grasp to begin recovering from health anxiety; I speak from experience.  One of the biggest things in recovery is how you deal with these thoughts and need for reassurance. Possibly even the key to fixing your health anxiety.  So  if you don't seek that reassurance  what's going to happen? For me  at first  it was unbareable anxiety  and just an extreme desire to check I was okay  whether that was through posting to the subreddit  the discord  asking family  checking my body for lumps  checking my lymph nodes etc.   You'll most likely experience increased anxiety whilst not seeking the reassurance you want  which is completely okay. Rather than seeking reassurance  do something mindful  something genuinely healthy for the mind. As  when in a very high anxiety situation  sometimes it's the things that you do during that time that really define how your mental wellbeing will go in the future.   You can do many things  for me  it was taking myself away from what I was doing and spending 10 minutes trying to immerse or distract myself within something else  not an easy task by any means  but something to try. After the 10 minutes was up I would come back to what I was doing and try to revert my thoughts away from my worry  which most times the anxiety had passed and I didn't need to seek further reassurance.   You could possibly try meditation  though  if you don't regularly practice it  it'll be very difficult to do under high anxiety levels.   You could try relaxing music  your favourite food  anything else that enhances your mood  whatever works for you.   During this time  you will experience anxiety  potentially more during that time of not seeking the reassurance  but I promise you  in the long run it is going to do wonderful things compared to getting the reassurance and feeding the problem.  When you seek reassurance  you're reinforcing the behaviours which keep your health anxiety alive unfortunately  because usually it feels like the right thing  and the only thing to do in that situation. But trust me  try not seeking it.

47,xereeto,Health Anxiety Starter Pack,Hey /r/healthanxiety    Just thought I'd make a post detailing my personal experience and knowledge about reassurance seeking and why it is self destructive.   So  you're experiencing your symptom that you're increasingly more worried about. Whether that be chest pains  heart palpitations  stomach problems  poop problems  any of the hundreds of symptoms any of us could possibly be worried about.   You're worried about if this is the time where your worrying is justified  or if it is actually a sign of the illness you're fearing.  Maybe you've already been to the doctor to get checked out  but doubt their opinion.  All of these have happened to me  and happen to many many other HA sufferers  which is completely okay.   **However**  the way you deal with it is paramount to your recovery.  Usually  what I would do  is post here  explaining my symptoms and what I was worried it was. Then I'd get some replies reassuring me and maybe feel better for a bit. Or I'd ask a close friend or family member and get the same results.  All of this felt like what I had to do  a huge compulsion to do this just to know that I was fine.   In the short term  yes  it made me feel better but this was only short lived.  This might also account for medical tests  I've spoken to many people who have previously thought that getting that MRI or CT  colonoscopy or endoscopy  or whatever it might be  would make all their worries go away. Which  after the short term relief  the anxiety came back. This is so important to understand and grasp to begin recovering from health anxiety; I speak from experience.  One of the biggest things in recovery is how you deal with these thoughts and need for reassurance. Possibly even the key to fixing your health anxiety.  So  if you don't seek that reassurance  what's going to happen? For me  at first  it was unbareable anxiety  and just an extreme desire to check I was okay  whether that was through posting to the subreddit  the discord  asking family  checking my body for lumps  checking my lymph nodes etc.   You'll most likely experience increased anxiety whilst not seeking the reassurance you want  which is completely okay. Rather than seeking reassurance  do something mindful  something genuinely healthy for the mind. As  when in a very high anxiety situation  sometimes it's the things that you do during that time that really define how your mental wellbeing will go in the future.   You can do many things  for me  it was taking myself away from what I was doing and spending 10 minutes trying to immerse or distract myself within something else  not an easy task by any means  but something to try. After the 10 minutes was up I would come back to what I was doing and try to revert my thoughts away from my worry  which most times the anxiety had passed and I didn't need to seek further reassurance.   You could possibly try meditation  though  if you don't regularly practice it  it'll be very difficult to do under high anxiety levels.   You could try relaxing music  your favourite food  anything else that enhances your mood  whatever works for you.   During this time  you will experience anxiety  potentially more during that time of not seeking the reassurance  but I promise you  in the long run it is going to do wonderful things compared to getting the reassurance and feeding the problem.

54,xereeto,Health Anxiety Starter Pack,Hey /r/healthanxiety    Just thought I'd make a post detailing my personal experience and knowledge about reassurance seeking and why it is self destructive.   So  you're experiencing your symptom that you're increasingly more worried about. Whether that be chest pains  heart palpitations  stomach problems  poop problems  any of the hundreds of symptoms any of us could possibly be worried about.   You're worried about if this is the time where your worrying is justified  or if it is actually a sign of the illness you're fearing.  Maybe you've already been to the doctor to get checked out  but doubt their opinion.  All of these have happened to me  and happen to many many other HA sufferers  which is completely okay.   **However**  the way you deal with it is paramount to your recovery.  Usually  what I would do  is post here  explaining my symptoms and what I was worried it was. Then I'd get some replies reassuring me and maybe feel better for a bit. Or I'd ask a close friend or family member and get the same results.  All of this felt like what I had to do  a huge compulsion to do this just to know that I was fine.   In the short term  yes  it made me feel better but this was only short lived.  This might also account for medical tests  I've spoken to many people who have previously thought that getting that MRI or CT  colonoscopy or endoscopy  or whatever it might be  would make all their worries go away. Which  after the short term relief  the anxiety came back. This is so important to understand and grasp to begin recovering from health anxiety; I speak from experience.  One of the biggest things in recovery is how you deal with these thoughts and need for reassurance. Possibly even the key to fixing your health anxiety.  So  if you don't seek that reassurance  what's going to happen? For me  at first  it was unbareable anxiety  and just an extreme desire to check I was okay  whether that was through posting to the subreddit  the discord  asking family  checking my body for lumps  checking my lymph nodes etc.   You'll most likely experience increased anxiety whilst not seeking the reassurance you want  which is completely okay. Rather than seeking reassurance  do something mindful  something genuinely healthy for the mind. As  when in a very high anxiety situation  sometimes it's the things that you do during that time that really define how your mental wellbeing will go in the future.   You can do many things  for me  it was taking myself away from what I was doing and spending 10 minutes trying to immerse or distract myself within something else  not an easy task by any means  but something to try. After the 10 minutes was up I would come back to what I was doing and try to revert my thoughts away from my worry  which most times the anxiety had passed and I didn't need to seek further reassurance.   You could possibly try meditation  though  if you don't regularly practice it  it'll be very difficult to do under high anxiety levels.   You could try relaxing music  your favourite food  anything else that enhances your mood  whatever works for you.   During this time  you will experience anxiety  potentially more during that time of not seeking the reassurance  but I promise you  in the long run it is going to do wonderful things compared to getting the reassurance and feeding the problem.

61,xereeto,Health Anxiety Starter Pack,Hey /r/healthanxiety    Just thought I'd make a post detailing my personal experience and knowledge about reassurance seeking and why it is self destructive.   So  you're experiencing your symptom that you're increasingly more worried about. Whether that be chest pains  heart palpitations  stomach problems  poop problems  any of the hundreds of symptoms any of us could possibly be worried about.   You're worried about if this is the time where your worrying is justified  or if it is actually a sign of the illness you're fearing.  Maybe you've already been to the doctor to get checked out  but doubt their opinion.  All of these have happened to me  and happen to many many other HA sufferers  which is completely okay.   **However**  the way you deal with it is paramount to your recovery.  Usually  what I would do  is post here  explaining my symptoms and what I was worried it was. Then I'd get some replies reassuring me and maybe feel better for a bit. Or I'd ask a close friend or family member and get the same results.  All of this felt like what I had to do  a huge compulsion to do this just to know that I was fine.   In the short term  yes  it made me feel better but this was only short lived.  This might also account for medical tests  I've spoken to many people who have previously thought that getting that MRI or CT  colonoscopy or endoscopy  or whatever it might be  would make all their worries go away. Which  after the short term relief  the anxiety came back. This is so important to understand and grasp to begin recovering from health anxiety; I speak from experience.  One of the biggest things in recovery is how you deal with these thoughts and need for reassurance. Possibly even the key to fixing your health anxiety.  So  if you don't seek that reassurance  what's going to happen? For me  at first  it was unbareable anxiety  and just an extreme desire to check I was okay  whether that was through posting to the subreddit  the discord  asking family  checking my body for lumps  checking my lymph nodes etc.   You'll most likely experience increased anxiety whilst not seeking the reassurance you want  which is completely okay. Rather than seeking reassurance  do something mindful  something genuinely healthy for the mind. As  when in a very high anxiety situation  sometimes it's the things that you do during that time that really define how your mental wellbeing will go in the future.   You can do many things  for me  it was taking myself away from what I was doing and spending 10 minutes trying to immerse or distract myself within something else  not an easy task by any means  but something to try. After the 10 minutes was up I would come back to what I was doing and try to revert my thoughts away from my worry  which most times the anxiety had passed and I didn't need to seek further reassurance.   You could possibly try meditation  though  if you don't regularly practice it  it'll be very difficult to do under high anxiety levels.   You could try relaxing music  your favourite food  anything else that enhances your mood  whatever works for you.   During this time  you will experience anxiety  potentially more during that time of not seeking the reassurance  but I promise you  in the long run it is going to do wonderful things compared to getting the reassurance and feeding the problem.  When you seek reassurance  you're reinforcing the behaviours which keep your health anxiety alive unfortunately  because usually it feels like the right thing  and the only thing to do in that situation. But trust me  try not seeking it.

68,xereeto,Health Anxiety Starter Pack,Hey /r/healthanxiety    Just thought I'd make a post detailing my personal experience and knowledge about reassurance seeking and why it is self destructive.   So  you're experiencing your symptom that you're increasingly more worried about. Whether that be chest pains  heart palpitations  stomach problems  poop problems  any of the hundreds of symptoms any of us could possibly be worried about.   You're worried about if this is the time where your worrying is justified  or if it is actually a sign of the illness you're fearing.  Maybe you've already been to the doctor to get checked out  but doubt their opinion.  All of these have happened to me  and happen to many many other HA sufferers  which is completely okay.   **However**  the way you deal with it is paramount to your recovery.  Usually  what I would do  is post here  explaining my symptoms and what I was worried it was. Then I'd get some replies reassuring me and maybe feel better for a bit. Or I'd ask a close friend or family member and get the same results.  All of this felt like what I had to do  a huge compulsion to do this just to know that I was fine.   In the short term  yes  it made me feel better but this was only short lived.  This might also account for medical tests  I've spoken to many people who have previously thought that getting that MRI or CT  colonoscopy or endoscopy  or whatever it might be  would make all their worries go away. Which  after the short term relief  the anxiety came back. This is so important to understand and grasp to begin recovering from health anxiety; I speak from experience.  One of the biggest things in recovery is how you deal with these thoughts and need for reassurance. Possibly even the key to fixing your health anxiety.  So  if you don't seek that reassurance  what's going to happen? For me  at first  it was unbareable anxiety  and just an extreme desire to check I was okay  whether that was through posting to the subreddit  the discord  asking family  checking my body for lumps  checking my lymph nodes etc.   You'll most likely experience increased anxiety whilst not seeking the reassurance you want  which is completely okay. Rather than seeking reassurance  do something mindful  something genuinely healthy for the mind. As  when in a very high anxiety situation  sometimes it's the things that you do during that time that really define how your mental wellbeing will go in the future.   You can do many things  for me  it was taking myself away from what I was doing and spending 10 minutes trying to immerse or distract myself within something else  not an easy task by any means  but something to try. After the 10 minutes was up I would come back to what I was doing and try to revert my thoughts away from my worry  which most times the anxiety had passed and I didn't need to seek further reassurance.   You could possibly try meditation  though  if you don't regularly practice it  it'll be very difficult to do under high anxiety levels.   You could try relaxing music  your favourite food  anything else that enhances your mood  whatever works for you.   During this time  you will experience anxiety  potentially more during that time of not seeking the reassurance  but I promise you  in the long run it is going to do wonderful things compared to getting the reassurance and feeding the problem.  When you seek reassurance  you're reinforcing the behaviours which keep your health anxiety alive unfortunately  because usually it feels like the right thing  and the only thing to do in that situation. But trust me  try not seeking it.

75,xereeto,Health Anxiety Starter Pack,Hey /r/healthanxiety    Just thought I'd make a post detailing my personal experience and knowledge about reassurance seeking and why it is self destructive.   So  you're experiencing your symptom that you're increasingly more worried about. Whether that be chest pains  heart palpitations  stomach problems  poop problems  any of the hundreds of symptoms any of us could possibly be worried about.   You're worried about if this is the time where your worrying is justified  or if it is actually a sign of the illness you're fearing.  Maybe you've already been to the doctor to get checked out  but doubt their opinion.  All of these have happened to me  and happen to many many other HA sufferers  which is completely okay.   **However**  the way you deal with it is paramount to your recovery.  Usually  what I would do  is post here  explaining my symptoms and what I was worried it was. Then I'd get some replies reassuring me and maybe feel better for a bit. Or I'd ask a close friend or family member and get the same results.  All of this felt like what I had to do  a huge compulsion to do this just to know that I was fine.   In the short term  yes  it made me feel better but this was only short lived.  This might also account for medical tests  I've spoken to many people who have previously thought that getting that MRI or CT  colonoscopy or endoscopy  or whatever it might be  would make all their worries go away. Which  after the short term relief  the anxiety came back. This is so important to understand and grasp to begin recovering from health anxiety; I speak from experience.  One of the biggest things in recovery is how you deal with these thoughts and need for reassurance. Possibly even the key to fixing your health anxiety.  So  if you don't seek that reassurance  what's going to happen? For me  at first  it was unbareable anxiety  and just an extreme desire to check I was okay  whether that was through posting to the subreddit  the discord  asking family  checking my body for lumps  checking my lymph nodes etc.   You'll most likely experience increased anxiety whilst not seeking the reassurance you want  which is completely okay. Rather than seeking reassurance  do something mindful  something genuinely healthy for the mind. As  when in a very high anxiety situation  sometimes it's the things that you do during that time that really define how your mental wellbeing will go in the future.   You can do many things  for me  it was taking myself away from what I was doing and spending 10 minutes trying to immerse or distract myself within something else  not an easy task by any means  but something to try. After the 10 minutes was up I would come back to what I was doing and try to revert my thoughts away from my worry  which most times the anxiety had passed and I didn't need to seek further reassurance.   You could possibly try meditation  though  if you don't regularly practice it  it'll be very difficult to do under high anxiety levels.   You could try relaxing music  your favourite food  anything else that enhances your mood  whatever works for you.   During this time  you will experience anxiety  potentially more during that time of not seeking the reassurance  but I promise you  in the long run it is going to do wonderful things compared to getting the reassurance and feeding the problem.

82,xereeto,Health Anxiety Starter Pack,Hey /r/healthanxiety    Just thought I'd make a post detailing my personal experience and knowledge about reassurance seeking and why it is self destructive.   So  you're experiencing your symptom that you're increasingly more worried about. Whether that be chest pains  heart palpitations  stomach problems  poop problems  any of the hundreds of symptoms any of us could possibly be worried about.   You're worried about if this is the time where your worrying is justified  or if it is actually a sign of the illness you're fearing.  Maybe you've already been to the doctor to get checked out  but doubt their opinion.  All of these have happened to me  and happen to many many other HA sufferers  which is completely okay.   **However**  the way you deal with it is paramount to your recovery.  Usually  what I would do  is post here  explaining my symptoms and what I was worried it was. Then I'd get some replies reassuring me and maybe feel better for a bit. Or I'd ask a close friend or family member and get the same results.  All of this felt like what I had to do  a huge compulsion to do this just to know that I was fine.   In the short term  yes  it made me feel better but this was only short lived.  This might also account for medical tests  I've spoken to many people who have previously thought that getting that MRI or CT  colonoscopy or endoscopy  or whatever it might be  would make all their worries go away. Which  after the short term relief  the anxiety came back. This is so important to understand and grasp to begin recovering from health anxiety; I speak from experience.  One of the biggest things in recovery is how you deal with these thoughts and need for reassurance. Possibly even the key to fixing your health anxiety.  So  if you don't seek that reassurance  what's going to happen? For me  at first  it was unbareable anxiety  and just an extreme desire to check I was okay  whether that was through posting to the subreddit  the discord  asking family  checking my body for lumps  checking my lymph nodes etc.   You'll most likely experience increased anxiety whilst not seeking the reassurance you want  which is completely okay. Rather than seeking reassurance  do something mindful  something genuinely healthy for the mind. As  when in a very high anxiety situation  sometimes it's the things that you do during that time that really define how your mental wellbeing will go in the future.   You can do many things  for me  it was taking myself away from what I was doing and spending 10 minutes trying to immerse or distract myself within something else  not an easy task by any means  but something to try. After the 10 minutes was up I would come back to what I was doing and try to revert my thoughts away from my worry  which most times the anxiety had passed and I didn't need to seek further reassurance.   You could possibly try meditation  though  if you don't regularly practice it  it'll be very difficult to do under high anxiety levels.   You could try relaxing music  your favourite food  anything else that enhances your mood  whatever works for you.   During this time  you will experience anxiety  potentially more during that time of not seeking the reassurance  but I promise you  in the long run it is going to do wonderful things compared to getting the reassurance and feeding the problem.  When you seek reassurance  you're reinforcing the behaviours which keep your health anxiety alive unfortunately  because usually it feels like the right thing  and the only thing to do in that situation. But trust me  try not seeking it.

89,xereeto,Health Anxiety Starter Pack,Hey /r/healthanxiety    Just thought I'd make a post detailing my personal experience and knowledge about reassurance seeking and why it is self destructive.   So  you're experiencing your symptom that you're increasingly more worried about. Whether that be chest pains  heart palpitations  stomach problems  poop problems  any of the hundreds of symptoms any of us could possibly be worried about.   You're worried about if this is the time where your worrying is justified  or if it is actually a sign of the illness you're fearing.  Maybe you've already been to the doctor to get checked out  but doubt their opinion.  All of these have happened to me  and happen to many many other HA sufferers  which is completely okay.   **However**  the way you deal with it is paramount to your recovery.  Usually  what I would do  is post here  explaining my symptoms and what I was worried it was. Then I'd get some replies reassuring me and maybe feel better for a bit. Or I'd ask a close friend or family member and get the same results.  All of this felt like what I had to do  a huge compulsion to do this just to know that I was fine.   In the short term  yes  it made me feel better but this was only short lived.  This might also account for medical tests  I've spoken to many people who have previously thought that getting that MRI or CT  colonoscopy or endoscopy  or whatever it might be  would make all their worries go away. Which  after the short term relief  the anxiety came back. This is so important to understand and grasp to begin recovering from health anxiety; I speak from experience.  One of the biggest things in recovery is how you deal with these thoughts and need for reassurance. Possibly even the key to fixing your health anxiety.  So  if you don't seek that reassurance  what's going to happen? For me  at first  it was unbareable anxiety  and just an extreme desire to check I was okay  whether that was through posting to the subreddit  the discord  asking family  checking my body for lumps  checking my lymph nodes etc.   You'll most likely experience increased anxiety whilst not seeking the reassurance you want  which is completely okay. Rather than seeking reassurance  do something mindful  something genuinely healthy for the mind. As  when in a very high anxiety situation  sometimes it's the things that you do during that time that really define how your mental wellbeing will go in the future.   You can do many things  for me  it was taking myself away from what I was doing and spending 10 minutes trying to immerse or distract myself within something else  not an easy task by any means  but something to try. After the 10 minutes was up I would come back to what I was doing and try to revert my thoughts away from my worry  which most times the anxiety had passed and I didn't need to seek further reassurance.   You could possibly try meditation  though  if you don't regularly practice it  it'll be very difficult to do under high anxiety levels.   You could try relaxing music  your favourite food  anything else that enhances your mood  whatever works for you.

You can do many things  for me  it was taking myself away from what I was doing and spending 10 minutes trying to immerse or distract myself within something else  not an easy task by any means  but something to try. After the 10 minutes was up I would come back to what I was doing and try to revert my thoughts away from my worry  which most times the anxiety had passed and I didn't need to seek further reassurance.   You could possibly try meditation  though  if you don't regularly practice it  it'll be very difficult to do under high anxiety levels.   You could try relaxing music  your favourite food  anything else that enhances your mood  whatever works for you.   During this time  you will experience anxiety  potentially more during that time of not seeking the reassurance  but I promise you  in the long run it is going to do wonderful things compared to getting the reassurance and feeding the problem.

96,xereeto,Health Anxiety Starter Pack,Hey /r/healthanxiety    Just thought I'd make a post detailing my personal experience and knowledge about reassurance seeking and why it is self destructive.   So  you're experiencing your symptom that you're increasingly more worried about. Whether that be chest pains  heart palpitations  stomach problems  poop problems  any of the hundreds of symptoms any of us could possibly be worried about.   You're worried about if this is the time where your worrying is justified  or if it is actually a sign of the illness you're fearing.  Maybe you've already been to the doctor to get checked out  but doubt their opinion.  All of these have happened to me  and happen to many many other HA sufferers  which is completely okay.   **However**  the way you deal with it is paramount to your recovery.  Usually  what I would do  is post here  explaining my symptoms and what I was worried it was. Then I'd get some replies reassuring me and maybe feel better for a bit. Or I'd ask a close friend or family member and get the same results.  All of this felt like what I had to do  a huge compulsion to do this just to know that I was fine.   In the short term  yes  it made me feel better but this was only short lived.  This might also account for medical tests  I've spoken to many people who have previously thought that getting that MRI or CT  colonoscopy or endoscopy  or whatever it might be  would make all their worries go away. Which  after the short term relief  the anxiety came back. This is so important to understand and grasp to begin recovering from health anxiety; I speak from experience.  One of the biggest things in recovery is how you deal with these thoughts and need for reassurance. Possibly even the key to fixing your health anxiety.  So  if you don't seek that reassurance  what's going to happen? For me  at first  it was unbareable anxiety  and just an extreme desire to check I was okay  whether that was through posting to the subreddit  the discord  asking family  checking my body for lumps  checking my lymph nodes etc.   You'll most likely experience increased anxiety whilst not seeking the reassurance you want  which is completely okay. Rather than seeking reassurance  do something mindful  something genuinely healthy for the mind.

After the 10 minutes was up I would come back to what I was doing and try to revert my thoughts away from my worry  which most times the anxiety had passed and I didn't need to seek further reassurance.   You could possibly try meditation  though  if you don't regularly practice it  it'll be very difficult to do under high anxiety levels.   You could try relaxing music  your favourite food  anything else that enhances your mood  whatever works for you.   During this time  you will experience anxiety  potentially more during that time of not seeking the reassurance  but I promise you  in the long run it is going to do wonderful things compared to getting the reassurance and feeding the problem.  When you seek reassurance  you're reinforcing the behaviours which keep your health anxiety alive unfortunately  because usually it feels like the right thing  and the only thing to do in that situation.

103,xereeto,Health Anxiety Starter Pack,Hey /r/healthanxiety    Just thought I'd make a post detailing my personal experience and knowledge about reassurance seeking and why it is self destructive.   So  you're experiencing your symptom that you're increasingly more worried about. Whether that be chest pains  heart palpitations  stomach problems  poop problems  any of the hundreds of symptoms any of us could possibly be worried about.   You're worried about if this is the time where your worrying is justified  or if it is actually a sign of the illness you're fearing.  Maybe you've already been to the doctor to get checked out  but doubt their opinion.  All of these have happened to me  and happen to many many other HA sufferers  which is completely okay.   **However**  the way you deal with it is paramount to your recovery.  Usually  what I would do  is post here  explaining my symptoms and what I was worried it was. Then I'd get some replies reassuring me and maybe feel better for a bit. Or I'd ask a close friend or family member and get the same results.  All of this felt like what I had to do  a huge compulsion to do this just to know that I was fine.   In the short term  yes  it made me feel better but this was only short lived.  This might also account for medical tests  I've spoken to many people who have previously thought that getting that MRI or CT  colonoscopy or endoscopy  or whatever it might be  would make all their worries go away. Which  after the short term relief  the anxiety came back. This is so important to understand and grasp to begin recovering from health anxiety; I speak from experience.  One of the biggest things in recovery is how you deal with these thoughts and need for reassurance. Possibly even the key to fixing your health anxiety.  So  if you don't seek that reassurance  what's going to happen? For me  at first  it was unbareable anxiety  and just an extreme desire to check I was okay  whether that was through posting to the subreddit  the discord  asking family  checking my body for lumps  checking my lymph nodes etc.   You'll most likely experience increased anxiety whilst not seeking the reassurance you want  which is completely okay. Rather than seeking reassurance  do something mindful  something genuinely healthy for the mind.

You can do many things  for me  it was taking myself away from what I was doing and spending 10 minutes trying to immerse or distract myself within something else  not an easy task by any means  but something to try. After the 10 minutes was up I would come back to what I was doing and try to revert my thoughts away from my worry  which most times the anxiety had passed and I didn't need to seek further reassurance.   You could possibly try meditation  though  if you don't regularly practice it  it'll be very difficult to do under high anxiety levels.   You could try relaxing music  your favourite food  anything else that enhances your mood  whatever works for you.   During this time  you will experience anxiety  potentially more during that time of not seeking the reassurance  but I promise you  in the long run it is going to do wonderful things compared to getting the reassurance and feeding the problem.  When you seek reassurance  you're reinforcing the behaviours which keep your health anxiety alive unfortunately  because usually it feels like the right thing  and the only thing to do in that situation.

110,xereeto,Health Anxiety Starter Pack,Hey /r/healthanxiety    Just thought I'd make a post detailing my personal experience and knowledge about reassurance seeking and why it is self destructive.   So  you're experiencing your symptom that you're increasingly more worried about. Whether that be chest pains  heart palpitations  stomach problems  poop problems  any of the hundreds of symptoms any of us could possibly be worried about.   You're worried about if this is the time where your worrying is justified  or if it is actually a sign of the illness you're fearing.  Maybe you've already been to the doctor to get checked out  but doubt their opinion.  All of these have happened to me  and happen to many many other HA sufferers  which is completely okay.   **However**  the way you deal with it is paramount to your recovery.  Usually  what I would do  is post here  explaining my symptoms and what I was worried it was. Then I'd get some replies reassuring me and maybe feel better for a bit. Or I'd ask a close friend or family member and get the same results.  All of this felt like what I had to do  a huge compulsion to do this just to know that I was fine.   In the short term  yes  it made me feel better but this was only short lived.  This might also account for medical tests  I've spoken to many people who have previously thought that getting that MRI or CT  colonoscopy or endoscopy  or whatever it might be  would make all their worries go away. Which  after the short term relief  the anxiety came back. This is so important to understand and grasp to begin recovering from health anxiety; I speak from experience.  One of the biggest things in recovery is how you deal with these thoughts and need for reassurance. Possibly even the key to fixing your health anxiety.  So  if you don't seek that reassurance  what's going to happen? For me  at first  it was unbareable anxiety  and just an extreme desire to check I was okay  whether that was through posting to the subreddit  the discord  asking family  checking my body for lumps  checking my lymph nodes etc.   You'll most likely experience increased anxiety whilst not seeking the reassurance you want  which is completely okay. Rather than seeking reassurance  do something mindful  something genuinely healthy for the mind.

Which  after the short term relief  the anxiety came back. This is so important to understand and grasp to begin recovering from health anxiety; I speak from experience.  One of the biggest things in recovery is how you deal with these thoughts and need for reassurance. Possibly even the key to fixing your health anxiety.  So  if you don't seek that reassurance  what's going to happen? For me  at first  it was unbareable anxiety  and just an extreme desire to check I was okay  whether that was through posting to the subreddit  the discord  asking family  checking my body for lumps  checking my lymph nodes etc.   You'll most likely experience increased anxiety whilst not seeking the reassurance you want  which is completely okay. Rather than seeking reassurance  do something mindful  something genuinely healthy for the mind. As  when in a very high anxiety situation  sometimes it's the things that you do during that time that really define how your mental wellbeing will go in the future.   You can do many things  for me  it was taking myself away from what I was doing and spending 10 minutes trying to immerse or distract myself within something else  not an easy task by any means  but something to try. After the 10 minutes was up I would come back to what I was doing and try to revert my thoughts away from my worry  which most times the anxiety had passed and I didn't need to seek further reassurance.   You could possibly try meditation  though  if you don't regularly practice it  it'll be very difficult to do under high anxiety levels.   You could try relaxing music  your favourite food  anything else that enhances your mood  whatever works for you.   During this time  you will experience anxiety  potentially more during that time of not seeking the reassurance  but I promise you  in the long run it is going to do wonderful things compared to getting the reassurance and feeding the problem.  When you seek reassurance  you're reinforcing the behaviours which keep your health anxiety alive unfortunately  because usually it feels like the right thing  and the only thing to do in that situation. But trust me  try not seeking it.  It'll be very similar to [this graph](https://thegirlwiththecurlyhair.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/anxiety-repeated-exposure-graph.png)  the more you do it the easier it'll be.

117,xereeto,Health Anxiety Starter Pack,Hey /r/healthanxiety    Just thought I'd make a post detailing my personal experience and knowledge about reassurance seeking and why it is self destructive.   So  you're experiencing your symptom that you're increasingly more worried about. Whether that be chest pains  heart palpitations  stomach problems  poop problems  any of the hundreds of symptoms any of us could possibly be worried about.   You're worried about if this is the time where your worrying is justified  or if it is actually a sign of the illness you're fearing.  Maybe you've already been to the doctor to get checked out  but doubt their opinion.  All of these have happened to me  and happen to many many other HA sufferers  which is completely okay.   **However**  the way you deal with it is paramount to your recovery.  Usually  what I would do  is post here  explaining my symptoms and what I was worried it was. Then I'd get some replies reassuring me and maybe feel better for a bit. Or I'd ask a close friend or family member and get the same results.  All of this felt like what I had to do  a huge compulsion to do this just to know that I was fine.   In the short term  yes  it made me feel better but this was only short lived.

All of these have happened to me  and happen to many many other HA sufferers  which is completely okay.   **However**  the way you deal with it is paramount to your recovery.  Usually  what I would do  is post here  explaining my symptoms and what I was worried it was. Then I'd get some replies reassuring me and maybe feel better for a bit. Or I'd ask a close friend or family member and get the same results.  All of this felt like what I had to do  a huge compulsion to do this just to know that I was fine.   In the short term  yes  it made me feel better but this was only short lived.  This might also account for medical tests  I've spoken to many people who have previously thought that getting that MRI or CT  colonoscopy or endoscopy  or whatever it might be  would make all their worries go away. Which  after the short term relief  the anxiety came back. This is so important to understand and grasp to begin recovering from health anxiety; I speak from experience.  One of the biggest things in recovery is how you deal with these thoughts and need for reassurance. Possibly even the key to fixing your health anxiety.  So  if you don't seek that reassurance  what's going to happen? For me  at first  it was unbareable anxiety  and just an extreme desire to check I was okay  whether that was through posting to the subreddit  the discord  asking family  checking my body for lumps  checking my lymph nodes etc.   You'll most likely experience increased anxiety whilst not seeking the reassurance you want  which is completely okay. Rather than seeking reassurance  do something mindful  something genuinely healthy for the mind. As  when in a very high anxiety situation  sometimes it's the things that you do during that time that really define how your mental wellbeing will go in the future.   You can do many things  for me  it was taking myself away from what I was doing and spending 10 minutes trying to immerse or distract myself within something else  not an easy task by any means  but something to try. After the 10 minutes was up I would come back to what I was doing and try to revert my thoughts away from my worry  which most times the anxiety had passed and I didn't need to seek further reassurance.   You could possibly try meditation  though  if you don't regularly practice it  it'll be very difficult to do under high anxiety levels.   You could try relaxing music  your favourite food  anything else that enhances your mood  whatever works for you.   During this time  you will experience anxiety  potentially more during that time of not seeking the reassurance  but I promise you  in the long run it is going to do wonderful things compared to getting the reassurance and feeding the problem.  When you seek reassurance  you're reinforcing the behaviours which keep your health anxiety alive unfortunately  because usually it feels like the right thing  and the only thing to do in that situation. But trust me  try not seeking it.  It'll be very similar to [this graph](https://thegirlwiththecurlyhair.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/anxiety-repeated-exposure-graph.png)  the more you do it the easier it'll be. And it might get to the point where the anxiety almost completely goes after a while of practicing this.   Seriously  it is worth definitely giving a go and thinking about this if you're currently having a lot of anxiety  I've been there hundreds of times  and applying this mentality was one of the key turning points into recovering from health anxiety.        ,https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/EsEzYQ23cDeBo6-gMHlxV1871w7TthguS8kdky-ZdH8.jpg,No video,2018-10-26 11:47:14,128.0,1311.0,83.0,ebarnes12,Type 1 diabetes for me,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.0,16336,

Usually  what I would do  is post here  explaining my symptoms and what I was worried it was. Then I'd get some replies reassuring me and maybe feel better for a bit. Or I'd ask a close friend or family member and get the same results.  All of this felt like what I had to do  a huge compulsion to do this just to know that I was fine.   In the short term  yes  it made me feel better but this was only short lived.  This might also account for medical tests  I've spoken to many people who have previously thought that getting that MRI or CT  colonoscopy or endoscopy  or whatever it might be  would make all their worries go away. Which  after the short term relief  the anxiety came back. This is so important to understand and grasp to begin recovering from health anxiety; I speak from experience.  One of the biggest things in recovery is how you deal with these thoughts and need for reassurance. Possibly even the key to fixing your health anxiety.  So  if you don't seek that reassurance  what's going to happen? For me  at first  it was unbareable anxiety  and just an extreme desire to check I was okay  whether that was through posting to the subreddit  the discord  asking family  checking my body for lumps  checking my lymph nodes etc.   You'll most likely experience increased anxiety whilst not seeking the reassurance you want  which is completely okay. Rather than seeking reassurance  do something mindful  something genuinely healthy for the mind. As  when in a very high anxiety situation  sometimes it's the things that you do during that time that really define how your mental wellbeing will go in the future.   You can do many things  for me  it was taking myself away from what I was doing and spending 10 minutes trying to immerse or distract myself within something else  not an easy task by any means  but something to try. After the 10 minutes was up I would come back to what I was doing and try to revert my thoughts away from my worry  which most times the anxiety had passed and I didn't need to seek further reassurance.   You could possibly try meditation  though  if you don't regularly practice it  it'll be very difficult to do under high anxiety levels.   You could try relaxing music  your favourite food  anything else that enhances your mood  whatever works for you.   During this time  you will experience anxiety  potentially more during that time of not seeking the reassurance  but I promise you  in the long run it is going to do wonderful things compared to getting the reassurance and feeding the problem.  When you seek reassurance  you're reinforcing the behaviours which keep your health anxiety alive unfortunately  because usually it feels like the right thing  and the only thing to do in that situation. But trust me  try not seeking it.  It'll be very similar to [this graph](https://thegirlwiththecurlyhair.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/anxiety-repeated-exposure-graph.png)  the more you do it the easier it'll be. And it might get to the point where the anxiety almost completely goes after a while of practicing this.

Or I'd ask a close friend or family member and get the same results.  All of this felt like what I had to do  a huge compulsion to do this just to know that I was fine.   In the short term  yes  it made me feel better but this was only short lived.  This might also account for medical tests  I've spoken to many people who have previously thought that getting that MRI or CT  colonoscopy or endoscopy  or whatever it might be  would make all their worries go away. Which  after the short term relief  the anxiety came back. This is so important to understand and grasp to begin recovering from health anxiety; I speak from experience.  One of the biggest things in recovery is how you deal with these thoughts and need for reassurance. Possibly even the key to fixing your health anxiety.  So  if you don't seek that reassurance  what's going to happen? For me  at first  it was unbareable anxiety  and just an extreme desire to check I was okay  whether that was through posting to the subreddit  the discord  asking family  checking my body for lumps  checking my lymph nodes etc.   You'll most likely experience increased anxiety whilst not seeking the reassurance you want  which is completely okay. Rather than seeking reassurance  do something mindful  something genuinely healthy for the mind. As  when in a very high anxiety situation  sometimes it's the things that you do during that time that really define how your mental wellbeing will go in the future.   You can do many things  for me  it was taking myself away from what I was doing and spending 10 minutes trying to immerse or distract myself within something else  not an easy task by any means  but something to try. After the 10 minutes was up I would come back to what I was doing and try to revert my thoughts away from my worry  which most times the anxiety had passed and I didn't need to seek further reassurance.   You could possibly try meditation  though  if you don't regularly practice it  it'll be very difficult to do under high anxiety levels.   You could try relaxing music  your favourite food  anything else that enhances your mood  whatever works for you.   During this time  you will experience anxiety  potentially more during that time of not seeking the reassurance  but I promise you  in the long run it is going to do wonderful things compared to getting the reassurance and feeding the problem.  When you seek reassurance  you're reinforcing the behaviours which keep your health anxiety alive unfortunately  because usually it feels like the right thing  and the only thing to do in that situation. But trust me  try not seeking it.  It'll be very similar to [this graph](https://thegirlwiththecurlyhair.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/anxiety-repeated-exposure-graph.png)  the more you do it the easier it'll be. And it might get to the point where the anxiety almost completely goes after a while of practicing this.   Seriously  it is worth definitely giving a go and thinking about this if you're currently having a lot of anxiety  I've been there hundreds of times  and applying this mentality was one of the key turning points into recovering from health anxiety.        ,https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/EsEzYQ23cDeBo6-gMHlxV1871w7TthguS8kdky-ZdH8.jpg,No video,2018-10-26 11:47:14,128.0,1311.0,97.0,itsyaboifranzi,hey no problem man  i know you didnt mean to. it's all good,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.19375,16350,

So  you're experiencing your symptom that you're increasingly more worried about. Whether that be chest pains  heart palpitations  stomach problems  poop problems  any of the hundreds of symptoms any of us could possibly be worried about.   You're worried about if this is the time where your worrying is justified  or if it is actually a sign of the illness you're fearing.  Maybe you've already been to the doctor to get checked out  but doubt their opinion.

Lasted a few weeks.  If it's any help to you  the twitching has stopped  and my anxiety has subsided  and it will for you too.   Not the best way to stop the anxiety but I actually started worrying I was having a heart attack instead hahaha!  I'm out of the tunnel at the moment  and I'm doing that thing where I look back  laugh and wonder how I could have been so stupid to worry. But I'll be back to the anxiety at some point no doubt.  I think I need to find what initially triggers it - it's often when I'm feeling great  feeling thankful for the life I have that my brain decides to tell me I'm probably going to die.  always here to talk if you need  friend!,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.16000000000000006,16353,

144,xereeto,Health Anxiety Starter Pack,Hey /r/healthanxiety    Just thought I'd make a post detailing my personal experience and knowledge about reassurance seeking and why it is self destructive.   So  you're experiencing your symptom that you're increasingly more worried about. Whether that be chest pains  heart palpitations  stomach problems  poop problems  any of the hundreds of symptoms any of us could possibly be worried about.   You're worried about if this is the time where your worrying is justified  or if it is actually a sign of the illness you're fearing.  Maybe you've already been to the doctor to get checked out  but doubt their opinion.  All of these have happened to me  and happen to many many other HA sufferers  which is completely okay.   **However**  the way you deal with it is paramount to your recovery.  Usually  what I would do  is post here  explaining my symptoms and what I was worried it was. Then I'd get some replies reassuring me and maybe feel better for a bit. Or I'd ask a close friend or family member and get the same results.  All of this felt like what I had to do  a huge compulsion to do this just to know that I was fine.   In the short term  yes  it made me feel better but this was only short lived.  This might also account for medical tests  I've spoken to many people who have previously thought that getting that MRI or CT  colonoscopy or endoscopy  or whatever it might be  would make all their worries go away. Which  after the short term relief  the anxiety came back. This is so important to understand and grasp to begin recovering from health anxiety; I speak from experience.  One of the biggest things in recovery is how you deal with these thoughts and need for reassurance. Possibly even the key to fixing your health anxiety.  So  if you don't seek that reassurance  what's going to happen? For me  at first  it was unbareable anxiety  and just an extreme desire to check I was okay  whether that was through posting to the subreddit  the discord  asking family  checking my body for lumps  checking my lymph nodes etc.   You'll most likely experience increased anxiety whilst not seeking the reassurance you want  which is completely okay. Rather than seeking reassurance  do something mindful  something genuinely healthy for the mind. As  when in a very high anxiety situation  sometimes it's the things that you do during that time that really define how your mental wellbeing will go in the future.   You can do many things  for me  it was taking myself away from what I was doing and spending 10 minutes trying to immerse or distract myself within something else  not an easy task by any means  but something to try. After the 10 minutes was up I would come back to what I was doing and try to revert my thoughts away from my worry  which most times the anxiety had passed and I didn't need to seek further reassurance.   You could possibly try meditation  though  if you don't regularly practice it  it'll be very difficult to do under high anxiety levels.   You could try relaxing music  your favourite food  anything else that enhances your mood  whatever works for you.   During this time  you will experience anxiety  potentially more during that time of not seeking the reassurance  but I promise you  in the long run it is going to do wonderful things compared to getting the reassurance and feeding the problem.  When you seek reassurance  you're reinforcing the behaviours which keep your health anxiety alive unfortunately  because usually it feels like the right thing  and the only thing to do in that situation. But trust me  try not seeking it.

151,xereeto,Health Anxiety Starter Pack,Hey /r/healthanxiety    Just thought I'd make a post detailing my personal experience and knowledge about reassurance seeking and why it is self destructive.   So  you're experiencing your symptom that you're increasingly more worried about. Whether that be chest pains  heart palpitations  stomach problems  poop problems  any of the hundreds of symptoms any of us could possibly be worried about.   You're worried about if this is the time where your worrying is justified  or if it is actually a sign of the illness you're fearing.  Maybe you've already been to the doctor to get checked out  but doubt their opinion.  All of these have happened to me  and happen to many many other HA sufferers  which is completely okay.   **However**  the way you deal with it is paramount to your recovery.  Usually  what I would do  is post here  explaining my symptoms and what I was worried it was. Then I'd get some replies reassuring me and maybe feel better for a bit. Or I'd ask a close friend or family member and get the same results.  All of this felt like what I had to do  a huge compulsion to do this just to know that I was fine.   In the short term  yes  it made me feel better but this was only short lived.  This might also account for medical tests  I've spoken to many people who have previously thought that getting that MRI or CT  colonoscopy or endoscopy  or whatever it might be  would make all their worries go away. Which  after the short term relief  the anxiety came back. This is so important to understand and grasp to begin recovering from health anxiety; I speak from experience.  One of the biggest things in recovery is how you deal with these thoughts and need for reassurance. Possibly even the key to fixing your health anxiety.  So  if you don't seek that reassurance  what's going to happen? For me  at first  it was unbareable anxiety  and just an extreme desire to check I was okay  whether that was through posting to the subreddit  the discord  asking family  checking my body for lumps  checking my lymph nodes etc.   You'll most likely experience increased anxiety whilst not seeking the reassurance you want  which is completely okay. Rather than seeking reassurance  do something mindful  something genuinely healthy for the mind. As  when in a very high anxiety situation  sometimes it's the things that you do during that time that really define how your mental wellbeing will go in the future.   You can do many things  for me  it was taking myself away from what I was doing and spending 10 minutes trying to immerse or distract myself within something else  not an easy task by any means  but something to try. After the 10 minutes was up I would come back to what I was doing and try to revert my thoughts away from my worry  which most times the anxiety had passed and I didn't need to seek further reassurance.

There is a rational (though very quiet) voice in my head that says the twitching is caused by recent physiotherapy  something that I've not undergone for any prolonged length of time until recently.   The physio is to treat some back pain and postural issues and some RSI from working at a desk 45 hours a week.   Mostly I feel as though I've got just  few years left  as though I'm really struggling with ALS.   This has been just one of the issues I have faced in recent years. Some other illnesses I've been worried about include testicular cancer - a lump was found  and for days between the scan and specialist appointment  I was catatonic  sure I was going to die. Even after being reassured twice from the most highly regarded specialist in Sydney  and three more ultrasounds  I was still skeptical  thinking gotye had missed something.   Ofcourse from there  my assumption has also been that the testicular cancer was secondary to the acid reflux that I've had repeatedly for about ten years  which I had only considered at this time to be a result of stomach cancer.   There is the constant fight against ""Alzheimer's"" that I am dealing with and have been for about eight years. It's all just so effed up...   More recently I've started to come to terms with the possibility that this is just something I am going to have to live with  and on better days  I realise that health anxiety is okay. On the worse days I feel as suicide is my only viable method of escaping this hell. Which is ironic because the majority of my anxieties rest on the possibility that I may die.   I've recently been referred to a psychiatrist and hope that this will help me to get on top of this often debilitating illness.

Or I'd ask a close friend or family member and get the same results.  All of this felt like what I had to do  a huge compulsion to do this just to know that I was fine.   In the short term  yes  it made me feel better but this was only short lived.  This might also account for medical tests  I've spoken to many people who have previously thought that getting that MRI or CT  colonoscopy or endoscopy  or whatever it might be  would make all their worries go away. Which  after the short term relief  the anxiety came back. This is so important to understand and grasp to begin recovering from health anxiety; I speak from experience.  One of the biggest things in recovery is how you deal with these thoughts and need for reassurance. Possibly even the key to fixing your health anxiety.  So  if you don't seek that reassurance  what's going to happen? For me  at first  it was unbareable anxiety  and just an extreme desire to check I was okay  whether that was through posting to the subreddit  the discord  asking family  checking my body for lumps  checking my lymph nodes etc.   You'll most likely experience increased anxiety whilst not seeking the reassurance you want  which is completely okay. Rather than seeking reassurance  do something mindful  something genuinely healthy for the mind. As  when in a very high anxiety situation  sometimes it's the things that you do during that time that really define how your mental wellbeing will go in the future.   You can do many things  for me  it was taking myself away from what I was doing and spending 10 minutes trying to immerse or distract myself within something else  not an easy task by any means  but something to try. After the 10 minutes was up I would come back to what I was doing and try to revert my thoughts away from my worry  which most times the anxiety had passed and I didn't need to seek further reassurance.   You could possibly try meditation  though  if you don't regularly practice it  it'll be very difficult to do under high anxiety levels.   You could try relaxing music  your favourite food  anything else that enhances your mood  whatever works for you.   During this time  you will experience anxiety  potentially more during that time of not seeking the reassurance  but I promise you  in the long run it is going to do wonderful things compared to getting the reassurance and feeding the problem.  When you seek reassurance  you're reinforcing the behaviours which keep your health anxiety alive unfortunately  because usually it feels like the right thing  and the only thing to do in that situation. But trust me  try not seeking it.  It'll be very similar to [this graph](https://thegirlwiththecurlyhair.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/anxiety-repeated-exposure-graph.png)  the more you do it the easier it'll be.

It’s free so I know I may be wasting time and also they won’t do any tests just to reassure me (my GP also ignores all real symptoms because it’s always “just anxiety”. Recently took me 3 months to get them to take excruciating stomach pain seriously!). If I was paying I’d pay for all the tests for some reassurance. All of the tests in existence. Except a lumbar puncture. Ouch. ,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.04583333333333337,16370,

I feel so stressed out about this and the more I stress about it the worse I'm getting.

I swear it drives us all a little nuts. There really should be an AI specialty because having it be treated as a flavor of a number of other specialties means there’s no one who really focuses on it. You go to an endo for Hashimotos and diabetes  a Castro for celiac  a rheumatologist for issues with your joints and connective tissues  and they rely upon basic primary care to identify this moving target. A lot of specialists don’t like dealing with it.   Often too you may have it but just not to the extent that you are diagnosable. They make it seem like magic. The fact that you have a doc entertaining the notion is a gift.

I went to see 4 doctors  most of them multiple times  and none of them suggested I get an MRI or even entertained the thought that I was right. One day last year I just said ""Fuck it  and fuck them!"" and paid out of pocket (live in England  the NHS is great but didn't help me here) to get a consultation with a Neurologist. It cost me nearly £1k of my savings but found out I was right all along.

169,Keir86,Health Anxiety - How it started and how I ended it quickly. My story,I've recently got through health anxiety and wanted to use my experience to help others. I've waffled on a bit so if you don't want to read it all please just read the top 2 points as they are the key. I can guarantee reading this is better time spent than googling symptoms.   Know your enemy  As you are on a health anxiety page you've likely had confusingly clear test results and already know your enemy isn't Cancer MS  HIV etc. It's anxiety.  Don't underestimate your enemy  Feeling physical symptoms that cannot possibly be anxiety? Wrong. The effects it can have on your body can be very physical  very painful  very scary and very real.   I'll have to start my story part-way through. I was running up the stairs at work to get to my desk in time and slipped. I fell awkwardly on the hand rail and heard and felt a rib crack. Work was a nightmare and had been for weeks. I'd just become the manager of a new team and things were going wrong. I carried on up the stairs in pain and a few days later went to hospital. I had a chest Xray and they confirmed a fractured rib. Work got worse and my cat became very ill (and I really love my cat).   Looking back all the signs were there months before this. Each time something stressful happened I got all hot  felt sick and lost my appetite. At the time I didn't think much of it. Then one morning everything changed.   A couple of days later  I woke up with what felt like a burning hot hand squeezing my heart. I couldn't breathe properly as I started to panic. I ask my girlfriend to take me to the emergency department and I genuinely thought I was going to die. I even kissed my cat goodbye thinking I'd never see her again. I got seen straight away. After an ECG and blood tests and a few hours of waiting  my chest had settled but was incredibly tight. I was asked if I had eaten anything yet. As I got there at 6am I said no. I was given toast and paracetamol and told there was nothing wrong with me and was shortly after sent home. I think leaving without an answer was a real tipping point.   I took 3 weeks off work and in that time my body and mind spiralled downwards. I kept catastrophizing. What if I get fired from my job? What if I can't work again and have to sell my house? What if I am seriously I'll…? And that one stuck.   Meanwhile my body was malfunctioning all over the place. My bowel habits changed for the worse  my digestion was all wrong with reflux and heartburn. I felt so weak and light headed. Then overnight I developed excruciating back pain that radiated up my neck. I was sure now that the doctors had made a mistake and that my attack that day was something more.   This carried on at varying degrees for months. Deep down I kind of felt I can't be that Ill as I went on holiday twice and felt a bit better when I was away. But then at it's worse I couldn't leave the house. I even text my girlfriend when she was at work to say I had a flesh eating skin disease. Now known as a blister in my toe...  I fell into the trap of googling symptoms and trying to use the internet for reassurance. I'd diagnose myself first with a stomach ulcer  then gallbladder disease then pancreatic cancer. New ones each week. Each time the doctor sent me for the tests which came back clear putting me back to square one believing it was me against the doctors who kept missing things.   One day after I had made 4 diagnoses in one day I felt enough was enough and contacted a councillor who fitted me in that day. She took me to the beginning of the story.  I just wanted her to fix me and was puzzled why she was asking about recent bereavements. Earlier in the year I had been at a close relatives bed side when they died and my dad had a very risky operation that was 50/50 if he would make it. I thought I had dealt with that. I got back into my car after the therapy session and was in tears. Obviously I hadn't.  She also made me think about what my triggers were. My back ache had worn off a little in recent weeks. A stressful conversation with my boss on the phone and it was back with a vengeance. So the link in my brain was now correctly back ache due to anxiety rather than back ache due to randomly malfunctioning organ.   I also went to my GP who put me on sertraline which is a commonly used antidepressant for anxiety. The side effects were difficult at first. In fact 3 days in I was having panic attacks but after a week the side effects subsided. After 4 weeks my physical symptoms virtually disappeared. My health anxiety went with those pretty much.  I suppose humans are great at suppressing the knowledge that we are all going to die some day otherwise life wouldn't be much fun. I think my experiences with death and illness of people close to me stopped me suppressing that and my stress and anxiety at the time made me relate it to myself.   So relating all of that together  here is my advice:  CBT. I have an app called Quirk that really helps. It gets you into the habit of challenging those irrational thoughts. If apps aren't your thing  imagine you are in a courtroom being cross examined for your irrational thought  being pressed for the actual evidence etc. Your brain carves out a path and the more you think the same  the better and easier that path becomes for your brain. Challenge this path to start closing it off.    Medication. I'd never taken antidepressants before and never wanted to but the truth is they just calmed my whole body down (after the side effects). My physical symptoms reduced greatly which was a game changer. Not saying they are right for everyone. Speak to your doctor of course. I'm definitely not a doctor.   Therapy. I was lucky enough to afford private therapy straight away. I would recommend it to anyone. They really get to the root cause. She helped me break the cycle by getting me to relate my symptoms to anxiety triggers and not other illnesses.    Lifestyle changes. Exercise helps but fitness isn't for everyone. I'm a much more creative person so I forced myself to write some music and did things I enjoy. Whatever you do to enjoy yourself is better than sat worrying and googling symptoms.   Work out your triggers. If a certain situation results in a certain symptom  this realisation can help immensely.   Dont rule out anxiety just because one of your many symptoms isn't on a list. We are all different.    DO NOT Google symptoms. If doctor google was real he would have been struck off by now for getting everything wrong.    Do not seek reassurance from statistics. If it says 1 in a million people your age will get this illness  you will still focus on the 1.   Do not seek confirmation of your self diagnosis from friends or family. This will only reinforce the faulty path your brain keeps sending signals down. Tell them to shut you down if you talk about health.    Keep busy and productive while taking care of yourself. If a friend was going through a tough time you'd but them a gift etc right?. Do it for yourself.

I had a chest Xray and they confirmed a fractured rib. Work got worse and my cat became very ill (and I really love my cat).   Looking back all the signs were there months before this. Each time something stressful happened I got all hot  felt sick and lost my appetite. At the time I didn't think much of it. Then one morning everything changed.   A couple of days later  I woke up with what felt like a burning hot hand squeezing my heart. I couldn't breathe properly as I started to panic. I ask my girlfriend to take me to the emergency department and I genuinely thought I was going to die. I even kissed my cat goodbye thinking I'd never see her again. I got seen straight away. After an ECG and blood tests and a few hours of waiting  my chest had settled but was incredibly tight. I was asked if I had eaten anything yet. As I got there at 6am I said no. I was given toast and paracetamol and told there was nothing wrong with me and was shortly after sent home. I think leaving without an answer was a real tipping point.   I took 3 weeks off work and in that time my body and mind spiralled downwards. I kept catastrophizing. What if I get fired from my job? What if I can't work again and have to sell my house? What if I am seriously I'll…? And that one stuck.   Meanwhile my body was malfunctioning all over the place. My bowel habits changed for the worse  my digestion was all wrong with reflux and heartburn. I felt so weak and light headed. Then overnight I developed excruciating back pain that radiated up my neck. I was sure now that the doctors had made a mistake and that my attack that day was something more.   This carried on at varying degrees for months. Deep down I kind of felt I can't be that Ill as I went on holiday twice and felt a bit better when I was away. But then at it's worse I couldn't leave the house. I even text my girlfriend when she was at work to say I had a flesh eating skin disease. Now known as a blister in my toe...  I fell into the trap of googling symptoms and trying to use the internet for reassurance. I'd diagnose myself first with a stomach ulcer  then gallbladder disease then pancreatic cancer. New ones each week. Each time the doctor sent me for the tests which came back clear putting me back to square one believing it was me against the doctors who kept missing things.   One day after I had made 4 diagnoses in one day I felt enough was enough and contacted a councillor who fitted me in that day. She took me to the beginning of the story.  I just wanted her to fix me and was puzzled why she was asking about recent bereavements. Earlier in the year I had been at a close relatives bed side when they died and my dad had a very risky operation that was 50/50 if he would make it. I thought I had dealt with that. I got back into my car after the therapy session and was in tears. Obviously I hadn't.  She also made me think about what my triggers were. My back ache had worn off a little in recent weeks. A stressful conversation with my boss on the phone and it was back with a vengeance. So the link in my brain was now correctly back ache due to anxiety rather than back ache due to randomly malfunctioning organ.   I also went to my GP who put me on sertraline which is a commonly used antidepressant for anxiety. The side effects were difficult at first. In fact 3 days in I was having panic attacks but after a week the side effects subsided. After 4 weeks my physical symptoms virtually disappeared. My health anxiety went with those pretty much.  I suppose humans are great at suppressing the knowledge that we are all going to die some day otherwise life wouldn't be much fun. I think my experiences with death and illness of people close to me stopped me suppressing that and my stress and anxiety at the time made me relate it to myself.   So relating all of that together  here is my advice:  CBT. I have an app called Quirk that really helps. It gets you into the habit of challenging those irrational thoughts. If apps aren't your thing  imagine you are in a courtroom being cross examined for your irrational thought  being pressed for the actual evidence etc. Your brain carves out a path and the more you think the same  the better and easier that path becomes for your brain. Challenge this path to start closing it off.    Medication. I'd never taken antidepressants before and never wanted to but the truth is they just calmed my whole body down (after the side effects). My physical symptoms reduced greatly which was a game changer. Not saying they are right for everyone. Speak to your doctor of course. I'm definitely not a doctor.   Therapy. I was lucky enough to afford private therapy straight away. I would recommend it to anyone. They really get to the root cause. She helped me break the cycle by getting me to relate my symptoms to anxiety triggers and not other illnesses.    Lifestyle changes. Exercise helps but fitness isn't for everyone. I'm a much more creative person so I forced myself to write some music and did things I enjoy. Whatever you do to enjoy yourself is better than sat worrying and googling symptoms.   Work out your triggers. If a certain situation results in a certain symptom  this realisation can help immensely.   Dont rule out anxiety just because one of your many symptoms isn't on a list. We are all different.    DO NOT Google symptoms. If doctor google was real he would have been struck off by now for getting everything wrong.    Do not seek reassurance from statistics. If it says 1 in a million people your age will get this illness  you will still focus on the 1.   Do not seek confirmation of your self diagnosis from friends or family. This will only reinforce the faulty path your brain keeps sending signals down. Tell them to shut you down if you talk about health.    Keep busy and productive while taking care of yourself. If a friend was going through a tough time you'd but them a gift etc right?. Do it for yourself.

I join the first discord years ago back when a child named TVMasterRace was an admin and he kicked me for asking him to not delete his comments.    This morning while browsing the sub I saw a user under the name of ColeT2014 said there was a new judgement free Discord server which he runs now.  After sharing my fear I was immediately attacked and labeled as schizophrenic by a user named “Ray”. Shortly after I started to ask him to stop harassing me ColeT finally logged in after multiple people pinged him for over 4 hours to stop a troll from spamming triggering stuff.   He then proceeded to mock me then ban me immediately.  Do not trust ColeT he is abusing his power.    I did some research and apparently there is an original discord server the he was banned from for mocking people with brain cancer fears and so he started this one so he can continue to bully people.  He is a liar and cannot be trusted.,self,No video,2019-07-16 08:05:10,0.0,1.0,5.0,,,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.0,16388,0.253
176,jadedvista,Putting the work in,"I've been in the worst ever HA spiral I've ever experienced in my life. At one point it was so severe I was doing some really desperate and nasty behavior to ""monitor"" and ""reassure"" myself. During the last two months I began to accept I'm dealing with mental illness  not just illness. This led me to get with a therapist and start medication. I kind of faltered for a month and skipped out on my therapy appointment  which understanding now that was to my total detriment. I know I wont get better if I approach this passively. So today I decided I'm seriously giving therapy my attention and I have an appointment scheduled. And now I'm working on cutting down on relying so heavily on medication (benzo)  with my med doctor's approval. Furthermore I'm setting goals to start exercising at least twice a week  drawing at least three times a week (my favorite hobby)  reading once a day  and making sure to treat myself to something nice at least once a week. A big and weird part of my HA included denying myself things I enjoyed  which made me further miserable and depressed. I write all this to say: I'm going to put in the work to actively seek to get better. This post will be my reminder - and maybe it even inspires others to put the work in too.   Please share your successes with getting better.

178,KevinTheKoop,Scared of contracting something from foster kittens,So the other day I was at a friend’s house. She fosters kittens. She had 3 of them. I held all of them.

Sometimes when we (me and my friend were both playing with them) would pet them  they’d reach out with their paws to get our finger and try to bite it. A few times I felt the kittens’ nails and I had to pull away from being bitten a few times. Probably just a kitty thing tho. They were about 4-5 weeks old.  Since then I’ve been experiencing EXTREME fatigue and weakness. I can’t stop sleeping  despite how much sleep I’m getting. I’m exhausted all the time. I’m convinced I contracted something from them...what if they weren’t vaccinated? At that age  aren’t they usually not vaccinated yet? Also they’re foster kittens so.

180,healthanxiety483829,Really anxious about rabies now,A month ago I was on a holiday in spain with a few friends. We went to see a church  which had a cat hanging out in the yard. No idea if it was a stray cat or owned by the church.  The cat looked really clean  acted super calm and friendly and let us play with her. At one point I got a deep scratch to my arm while playing with her. Back then I thought nothing of it  I disinfected the wound at our hotel as good as I could  and went on my holiday. The wound healed in less than a week after i got it. Never thought about vaccinating myself afterwards.   Recently I read about rabies and the ways it can be transmitted and being the anxious person that I am  I became a bit worried as I remembered this incident. I have no way of to monitor if the cat is still alive since I am in my own country and the cat is In spain.  A few days ago  i started to feel kind of felt warm tingling sensations around the very area of my wound  which i've read is a symptom of rabies. I also have difficulties swallowing  (no hydrophobia or anything through)  loss of appetite and feelings that the tingling is spreading etc. Am I really dying or what the hell is going on???

185,Mattimuss,Made a step in the right direction,Went up north on Thursday to visit a sister up north a bit of me and came back down with her and her husband Sunday. That was one of the best things I’ve done  my HA took a big back step and it was great. Just hanging out with them; who I haven’t seen in awhile and somewhere new with their dog as well helped immensely. Got back yesterday with them and today my HA tried to start going but I shut most of it down. Went for a walk as usual and when I got back just noticed 2 small like spots on my right thumb which first my HA almost got me but I know it’s only peronychia as the 2 like spots are different coloured  one is red and one is like the dark colour you get of an old wound. It’s prime for what I have on a couple fingers and thumbs occasionally. I really have to work out how to stop the peronychia though  however I’m happy I didn’t let my brain run wild with stupid silly thoughts about bats as that isn’t plausible in the slightest. I hope everyone else is doing well in their own battles,self,No video,2019-07-15 18:14:28,0.0,5.0,0.0,,,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.0,16398,0.108

Since I was in elementary school and I'm well into my 20s now. I'm thinking of how I've damaged my skin and that I have skin cancer now because my skin picking and sun exposure to the damaged skin. I never looked long at my face growing up but I do now and I noticed little moles here and there and I'm convinced it's all melanoma. And then I'm scared my entire nose will have to be scraped off and what will I look like then...  I just want to get a good night's rest. I want to just.... Look the way I want and STOP picking that spot on my nose that's been the source of self image/esteem issues. I want to look the way I want and stop freaking out about the many tiny moles I have and just SLEEP. I want to get a good night's rest.  Why can't I do that? I hate anxiety. So. Damn. Much...

My chest does hurt  it’s not hard to breathe but I am worried that something may have happened. The only thing wrong is my chest hurting.   Does anyone else ever feel this way?,self,No video,2019-07-15 18:41:51,0.0,1.0,0.0,,,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.0,16420,0.18
208,Frikken,My story  and seeking help.,A few years ago  I had an allergic reaction to something I really never figured out. The doctor at the ER said it was likely the ear drops I was taking for my ear infection. Before that  I never really was concerned about my health  and hated going to the doc. Afterwards  it spiraled out of control. Suddenly  I was avoiding everything for fear of allergies. Then it was cancer  and stroke  and other things I started worrying about. I started going to the doc and got checked regularly  everything was always fine. I got psychiatric help and was put on anxiety meds  and I started therapy.  Over the next 6 months  I went from panic attacks every day to every other day  to once a week  and soon enough  a few times a year. I got off the meds  I stopped going to therapy  and I stopped going to the doc. I focused on work and went back to my old ways  as if it never happened.  A couple weeks ago  I went to the ER for chest pains. I thought I was having a heart attack or something  but they ruled that out Completely  told me it was likely just GERD. since then  my anxiety has come back  and I'm once again on meds and seeking therapy. I've had a few breakdowns already but this time I know I have to strike first.  It's absolute hell living with anxiety  and I should have continued regular checkups and made lifestyle changes.  If you're going through this  go seek help  and don't wait. Go see the doctor  get checkups and be the healthiest you that you can be. When you start to control your health  you can control your anxiety too. Some things can't be helped  but you can do your best to make sure the likeliness of anything bad happening is minimal.   If you're scared to see the doctor  just do it. You don't suddenly become sick because the doctor said so  they're telling you what was already happening. And the sooner you get that fixed  the better. Hell  you might be like me and have them tell you that you're perfectly healthy. Same for your mental health too. If you live day after day in the same cycle  you will lose yourself. Break the cycle and take steps to help yourself.,self,No video,2019-07-15 09:45:00,0.0,5.0,0.0,,,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.0,16421,0.0

Also it gets rarer if it's not something running in your family. What I like to think about aside from this number is that there are so many approaches and doctors studying how to stop the disease and there are studies showing that on average people now live more when they have the disease. I want to believe that (in my case) in the next 30 years more a less we will be able to find a solution to cure this shit. I know it is not much but it does help me when I start feeling very depressed about it.

My resting heart rate is between 58-65. When I go to the DR it spikes up to 95-105. When the blood pressure cuff goes on it goes up to 155.   You may have a phobia of it being monitored and that’s why it always measures high.   Also palpitation note- I thought my heart was skipping beats 8-12 times a day for 3 months- went to a cardiologist did a 48 hour Holter monitor and it didn’t catch a single thing. Once he told me that  I literally never felt them again. They were completely in my head. Anxiety is STRONG.   However  with all of the above said- I have a very good friend who’s heart rate was similar to yours and she was actually diagnosed with a rare heart problem. She got put on medication and is completely okay and isn’t expected to have any issues. If I were you I’d go see a cardiologist. The Holter monitor is probably where they’d start and it’s non invasive and pretty easy.   I hope you figure it out- but avoiding testing it is counter intuitive! If you do have a high HR problem you would just take beta blockers like the guy below mentioned.

Constant palpitations  even chest pain at one point. My resting heart rate was always 98-120. I would keep myself up all hours of the night hyper-focusing on all of it. I wasn't physically active at all.  After a few urgent care visits to check my heart  I was told everything looked perfectly fine. So I started trying to be proactive. First change I made was taking a magnesium supplement daily. The pounding heart and palpitations immediately disappeared. Magnesium is one of those things you really need in order to feel normal  and a lot of people don't have a proper diet that meets their needs. If your diet is poor I'd definitely start taking daily supplements.  My heart rate was still on the high side but I stopped feeling so weak. Next  I started walking. Which quickly became one of my favorite things to do. I'd just roam around town  check out neighborhoods and streets I've never walked down. I started hitting 10 000 steps frequently. That's when my heart rate changed. Exercise will 100% help you. My resting rate is now 58-70. This happened after maybe a month of consistent walking. It doesn't take much and the payoff is incredible. My health anxiety got a lot better  probably because I just felt better.  If you're living a very sedentary lifestyle  your body will have a lot of built up energy. If you don't release this energy  you'll start getting anxiety. It leaves too much free time for your mind to start freaking yourself out. You're incredibly young  you don't have heart problems. You're just putting junk into your body and not taking proper care of yourself so you don't feel good. You absolutely have the ability to change all of this! :),,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.15594276094276094,16436,

I was avoiding reality. I had pericarditis  a heart infection that usually is harmless if treated  and developed such bad anxiety that I avoided my follow up appointments with my cardiologist.   Long story short- once I started going to home it was the fastest way to calm me down and get me back to reality. There were dozens of tests done on me to  prove my heart was fine. It was a long road but still to this day  those real results and tests  are my biggest reassurance about my health.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",-0.006837606837606818,16440,

At the time I started out by taking Mag-Ox (its a brand that has the most stable form of magnesium that will absorb the best) and always took it at night because it helps you get a restful nights sleep. Besides that  I would add in just a normal multi-vitamin.  Based off your replies to some other posts here  it really just sounds like your unhealthy lifestyle and diet. I really really wouldn't let your brain run away with it (easier said than done  I know). Caffeine is not your friend  and terrible sleep schedules really destroy any hope of you feeling 'normal' until that stuff gets straightened out. It took me years to pull myself together and figure all this out and fix everything. But just try to make small changes here and there  eat more vegetables and take some vitamins. You'll notice a difference and it will hopefully push you to want to continue to take better care of yourself :),,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.1203125,16441,

I had this bottle of water that I refilled on the sink and when drinking from it I felt this smell coming from the bottle neck  I only took a few sips from it until I noticed what was going on.

250,MakeupMua16,Really scared something is wrong with me!?,So for the past like 2-3 months I’ve been extremely tired to the point I’ve been taking naps during the day almost every single day. It’s gotten to the point I feel so tired but I’m sick of taking a nap sick of sleeping because I sleep so much than usual. Also I’ve been having this strange anal itching for the past almost two years (before this whole anxiety attack started where I needed medication by the way) that no doctor can find anything wrong except my primary just thinks it’s anxiety which the anxiety meds do help my itching but not 100%. Since the sleeping problem has happened I’ve been on Zoloft for my anxiety so I don’t know if it’s the medication causing me to be extremely tired or that’s just a coincidence I’ve been on medication going on almost 3 months now and since about two weeks ago I switched to Effexor and I’m still just as tired as I was on Zoloft. I don’t know what’s wrong and why I’m sleeping so much. I’ve never had this problem before sleeping all the time or any sleep problem I usually sleep a good 8-9 hours and have no problems now I can still sleep that much but I’m tired mid day everyday and it’s really getting old. My mom thinks it’s because I’m lazy and don’t get out and do anything why I’m always sleepy but I think not even when I do go out and do things or when I’m working I still feel tired.

Vitamin D  B12  iron  anxiety itself  thyroid  ect. Have they checked your blood for these things and a cbc? That would probably relieve your mind a lot.  As for the itching  I'm assuming you've had an exam done for that? If not  have one. Most of the time that's hemmoroids or skin irritation from really anything and the two (itching and tired) are not likely connected :),,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.0975,16463,0.313

267,7synth,Ambiguous nerve health anxiety,So I’ve had health anxiety for a while along with OCD. Sometimes more minor health anxiety and sometimes more severe  and the past couple of months it’s been on my mind more and making me feel depressed everyday. Part of my OCD is that I tense up the muscles around my forehead and strain my eyes when opening and closing them and count the times I do it (sounds weird and hard to describe). My “symptoms” started in May when I had a numbness/pressure in one toe. Then I started worrying that I felt it in my leg/hands/arm too but since have realized that was my anxiety about it and it’s just a problem in my toe. I’ve gone through worrying about just about every disease I can think of it could be related to (I’ll avoid mentioning here since I know reading about any can be triggering). But now I’ve gotten to worrying that the straining of my muscles in my forehead and straining my eyes by opening/closing could affect my brain somehow and damage some nerve connection that could be causing the numbness/pressure in my toe and that continuing it could cause more problems. From typing it out I know this all sounds crazy but is it at all possible that straining muscles in my eyes/forehead could cause some sort of nerve damage or affect my brain? I know truthfully probably not but I feel like I go through the same cycles of worrying about this everyday.,self,No video,2019-07-15 06:44:50,1.0,2.0,0.0,GlutenFreeFratBoy,Believe it or not  I’ve stressed about the same thing before  as I have a similar (undiagnosed) OCD-ish tic and am currently trying to get a diagnosis for a handful of bizarre and still unexplained nerve related pains. The short answer is that no  clenching does not cause brain damage  or doctors would have made such a simple connection a long time ago and we would be taught from a young age to be careful not to clench for that reason.  Clenching can sometimes lead to tightness  though  that can cause weird sensations and occasionally pain in other parts of the body. It’s nothing dangerous  but when this is the case finding ways to stop/limit clenching usually helps alleviate the symptom. THAT BEING SAID it’s really  really  REALLY unlikely that clenching/straining in the head is causing what you’re experiencing  and even if it is  it’s not a serious cause for concern.  If I were in your shoes  I’d probably just see my doctor as it could in theory be a more local compressed nerve  which most people get at one point or another and is very benign.

268,kvis_,Long-term health anxiety or actual illness? Infections  fatigue.,"Landed here  folks. I have made more doctor visits since fall 2018  than I have total in my life. Since tests have frequently not shown anything/ doctors aren't concerned/ etc.  beginning to think it's just.. in my head? I'm going to throw my journey out there (including everything) and hope for recommendations for either quelling hypochondria or else suggestions for what to ask my doctor from people with similar experiences?  TLDR; Unexplained weight loss  recurrent infections  fatigue  normal labs  no real answers. What can I do?  &#x200B;  First doctor visit was last fall because I noticed my weight was dropping  without explanation.  I've maintained the same \~130 since I was 19 (I'm now 29) and had been up to 135 about 6 months before this visit.  I had dropped down to \~125.  Doctor more or less told me that I'm a thin person and a little weight seems like a lot - no big deal.   Then in Nov.  I was tested and treated for strep throat.  The rapid test was not positive  but because of symptoms and considering my work environment (preschool) and the number of actual positive tests around me at the time  including the teacher I shared a room with - doctor thought it seemed likely. Completed 1 10-day course of amoxicillin.  Around Dec  I noticed vaginal changes. No major changes to sex life - regardless  I had an STD screening done. Negative for everything. Had a second screening done 2 months later when issues didn't resolve - also negative. This has been on-going with no answers and no clear time-line in my memory so i'll just say I've been sleeping with the same person in the last 12 months - with one encounter with another female. Since Dec  I've been treated for a UTI (symptoms present but test negative)  BV (symptoms present  but test negative/""it didn't look like BV under microscope  but let's just treat it and see"")  and ... half a dozen yeast infections usually around the time of antibiotic use which is pretty typical for me.  In April and then again in May  I had strep throat.  These rapid tests were positive.  I was treated once more with a 10-day amoxicillin the first time  and 5-day z-pak second.  Also in April  major fatigue set in  and I noticed I was down to 120 lbs.  another 5 lbs in a 4 month period.  Again  not much but  I'm thin-framed  5'6"" and have maintained the same weight for over a decade. People started commenting on the difference. The fatigue has been present since this time.  For about a month after the first bout of strep  the fatigue was pretty major. Falling asleep at 8pm with the lights on  napping in the afternoons (I never nap  I've always been high-energy  wake up in the mornings peppy  function optimally on 7-8 hours a night.  <-- The fatigue has improved but I can say none of these things are true any longer.)  Last month  symptoms of strep popped up again minus the 103 fever.  Rapid strep test negative.  While at Dr  noticed weight dropped to 114 - now lower than my high school baseline despite expecting an increase due to ravenous appetite  incorporation of more carbs and fats.  Doctor ordered standard CBC and thyroid tests.  Aside for slightly elevated total protein  nothing else was abnormal.  A couple other things going on which haven't been brought to doctor visits - consistently cloudy urine  and breast pain/nipple changes.  My understanding that the breast changes could very well be related to the weight loss. One breast feels different  but no apparent lumps/bumps.  I'm pretty exhausted and financially/mentally broke by all of this.  I've always been a healthy person  keeping health/diet a top priority. Aside from \^\^\^  I've been sick a handful of times my adult life.  I eat well  I'm physically active.

I  like many of you here  feel physical symptoms and pain that feel  and ostensibly  are  real  even if they’re psychosomatic or brought on by the anxiety itself. I’m committed to the idea that the real issue is the health anxiety  and not any one symptom. My question  though  is if any of you have tips on focusing on the anxiety as the issue and not fixating on symptoms?

The major thing that I did at first was research anxiety and panic disorders extensively. I read up on all of the symptoms of this disorder  a massive list. I then began to instead of focusing on the random ""symptoms"" of some far fetched condition  focusing on them as anxiety symptoms. The tingling in my hands and feet no longer meant Multiple Sclerosis/Diabetes. The random speech errors and typing errors no longer meant brain tumor or other neurological condition. I had to force myself recognize that all I am feeling is anxiety.  Its like reteaching yourself how to ride a bike  there was a time when you never worried about your health (more than likely). You have to constantly reassure yourself that you are fine despite never feeling fine.  Also make sure that you are sleeping on time. I find that I am most anxious when I go to bed after 1 AM or if I do not get enough sleep. Prioritize 8 hours a night and switch back to a sleep schedule in which you go to bed early and wake up early.  Another good tip is a healthy diet. Try to avoid fast food and prepackaged meals. We are human  and it is OK to go and get fast food occasionally  I try not to more than 2 or 3 times a week (as a 21 year old). Magnesium Citrate  Vitamin D3 (2000u) and a daily multivitamin can also make you have more energy. The Magnesium helps regulate brain traffic (lowering general daily anxiety) and also helps with muscle pains and general aches.  Get into the habit of working out. At least 3 times a week. Whether it be running  weight training  or just a nice 15 minute walk  it helps immensely.  Finally  reading helps a lot.

I feel like so many of us worry  ""am I sick? What should i do?"" And the reality of it is  we ARE sick. We have anxiety. And instead of treating our real condition  we are distracted by chasing solutions to imaginary diseases. Getting down to the root  to the anxiety  addresses all of our psychosomatic symptoms at once  so we have less aches and pains to catastrophize over.  I would first set an appointment with a mental health professional who can give you an objective third-party opinion of your situation  as well as tools and techniques to help differentiate anxiety symptoms from real symptoms. Improving your mental health will simultaneously improve all of the symptoms that manifest as a result of anxiety  so you wont feel as sick physically. It is truly a ""many birds with one stone"" approach.   Also take steps to improve your physical and mental health on your own. Physical activity has innumerable benefits for all aspects of your health  and it can help you develop more trust in your body to function properly. Start slow and be consistent  and feeling/seeing the results will be a big boon to your progress. You have a lot of options to choose from: weight training  running  swimming  biking  yoga  hiking  etc. Eat a healthy well-balanced diet. Find hobbies that you enjoy and that will keep you grounded and distracted when anxiety rears its ugly head (reading  journaling  video games  crafting  painting  playing an instrument  learning a skill or language  etc).

The lump doesnt grow any bigger and it feels like it got smaller but still worry me. there still pressure there when I press it,self,No video,2019-07-15 07:18:37,6.0,1.0,5.0,formalde_heidi,I have dental anxiety too so I can understand your fear of the numbing shots. But you've had the best type of doctor look at your mouth and not see any sign of cancer. If you are still worried  then the problem that needs to be solved now is not cancer but anxiety. Can you set an appointment with a mental health professional to talk about your worries? They can help you see the situation more clearly.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.32,16505,
293,chaiichi,Sever Joint Pains, Tldr; I always have this unusual joint pain that is so severe it makes me wanna throw up. Painkiller didnt work. (I took Mefenamic acid  then celecoxib for the second dose when that didn't work)  This started when I was 14 - 15 yrs old after we went hiking on a rainforest. I am guessing my leg muscles started to hurt due to stress of walking long hours soaking in the rain. We went home and I remember just crawling down the stairs after I showered.  Fast forward 11 years later (now) the muscle and joint pains worsened about 200%. The progress of the pain was so gradual through the years.  At first  I would start getting them when my joint gets stressed  like after sitting on the computer for a long time with bad arm positiong for the mouse  I would get them on my wrists.   If I do repetitive actions like brushing the tiles for example  I would get them on my arms.   5 years ago  I noticed I would get them on my knees   and arms after workout without warm up. I now make sure I warm before exercising.  This year  it escalated pretty fast. I would get the joint pains from the tip of my fingers up to the shoulders to my shoulder blades after doing the laundry! It is insane because laundry is a simple task of putting clothes in the washer and folding them.   When I work with super cold water  I sure get them in my hands up to my shoulder blades.   When sleeping  I should be aware none of my arm or leg gets stressed or left in the same position for so long.  It is either no pain   or there's severe pain. If I can describe it with 1 to 10   with 10 being the most painful  it would be 15! The pain is enough to not allow me to move my arms. One single touch to the affected arm is like a hot iron being pressed to that area being touched.  I  got it again today on my right arm because I must have slept on it for too long. This time the pain made me feel nauseous and really really tired. I took the usual pain killer and it didnt do anything so Im worried.   The hot compress worked though. Made me sleep for a bit.

As you can probably guess  I mistake the panic attack for an asthma attack  and sometimes I even worry that the panic attack could even cause an asthma attack.  Eczema doesn’t really play a part in causing health anxiety  but sometimes the stress and frustration from being worried can aggravate and trigger flare-ups on my skin.

One time from eating a slice of salmon. It varies every time. I’ll eat that meal again and I don’t have it. I’ll eat a huge meal and feel perfectly fine.

341,fabiogpl,Do you get intense pins and needles in chest?,Quick background: I have had ectopic beats for more than 13 years. Last year they got really bad. Every day and many times a day. Had ECG and EKG and all is fine. Started taking magnesium supplements which really helped and they are less frequent now (placebo?). But recently I am having these intense pins and needles in the left side of my chest for about 3 seconds then they go away...so obviously anxiety says its impending doom. Does anyone have this stuff and can anxiety trigger such strong sensations?? Thanks!,self,No video,2019-07-14 22:56:27,1.0,1.0,0.0,GlutenFreeFratBoy,I get that  among a lot of pins and needles in a lot of other areas. I’ve noticed the chest ones in particular are most frequent when I’m already extremely anxious. Had a normal EKG during a panic-attack fueled ER visit in February  and having an echo soon at the recommendation of my doctor  not because he thinks I have a heart condition but because he wants to be thorough and wants to give me full peace of mind.  Chest pain is probably the scariest of any sort of pain for people like us  but what helps me is to remind myself that if I’m actually having a cardiac event (which I shouldnt bc I’m very young)  I’ll know - it more than likely won’t just be some sporadic chest pains that I’m already familiar with.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.14977777777777776,16554,0.0

If you’re getting different symptoms every time  like me  it makes it easier to realize this. I’ve had different symptoms every month for the past year.

I felt like I wasn't confident judging the distance between the car in front of me and myself. I then started to realise I couldn't quite read things. For example  if I looked at the temp that said 16  I could only see the 6. Similarly  I looked at the time (14:44) and could see there were some fours  but was struggling. It was really weird  because everything was clear. It was sort of just like there was a blank part of my vision  even though I couldn't see a dark shadow or anything.  I then realised when I had both hands on the wheel  I couldn't see my left hand.  When I got out  I felt dizzy and the top of my vision was shimmering quite a bit. But within about half an hour  it returned to normal. A slight migraine has formed  but just a small one.  I'm wondering if this is just an ocular migraine? The symptoms on the NHS site seem somewhat similar.  In the last year or so  I've had visual snow and afterimages  but I've been to the neurologist who more or less dismissed me and said I was fine.

I have this exact same thing going on with me right now. I'm 20 and my doc thinks I have POTS  though I haven't done a TTT yet. I also have costo + myalgias  so I feel like I'm having a heart attack constantly LOL.  I can't really offer any advice other than this: just know that your heart *wants* to work properly. I'm assuming that you've had a full cardiac workup  so if thats the case  then you are *less* likely than the general population to have any sort of issue since you've been thoroughly screened. Most people have no idea what's really going on with their hearts until it's too late and they end up in an emergency situation. Younger people who die from sudden cardiac death  often have disorders that were unknown/rare/asymptomatic at the time. Since you've gotten cleared by your doc (and probably specialists like EP or cardiology I'm assuming?) then you should should be a little bit more eased --- though I understand that the symptoms are scary! Right now  you are probably hyper-focused on your heart  and feeling every little sensation  which results in more anxiety  which results in more palpitations/tachycardia ---- creating this loop of fear.

381,Anxiousone11,Here back at it again  now it’s Breast cancer,I noticed after leaving my NuvaRing in for a full month that my boobs were super sore. So I let myself get a period and moved along. After my period passed I saw some red vertical likes on my lower boobs (both sides) and then today I noticed that I have some vertical indentations or dimples when I bend down or push my boobs together. There is literally nothing else on Dr. google about this besides breast cancer.

First set an appointment with a mental health professional who can give you an objective third-party opinion of your situation  as well as tools and techniques to help differentiate anxiety symptoms from real symptoms. Improving your mental health will simultaneously improve all of the symptoms that manifest as a result of anxiety  so you wont feel as sick physically.   Also take steps to improve your physical and mental health on your own. Physical activity has innumerable benefits for all aspects of your health  and it can help you develop more trust in your body to function properly. Start slow and be consistent  and feeling/seeing the results will be a big boon to your progress. Eat a healthy well-balanced diet. Find hobbies that you enjoy and that will keep you grounded and distracted when anxiety rears its ugly head.  I know it feels like we're all just helpless victims to this monster called health anxiety  but that's not the case. There are very real steps we can take to overcome this burden  and only by taking those steps can we start to turn our life around.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.042360248447204964,16626,0.008

424,jadedvista,Can finally share a HA story,Starting end of April I began seeing spots of bright red blood when I wiped after a bowel movement. It was happening every few days. This severely heightened my anxiety. I shortly after began to notice a change in the consistency of my stool - looser at times  lots of undigested food  mucus  yellow colored  always wiping yellow. I decided to wait three weeks to just see if it was a bug my system was working out  but meanwhile my anxiety continued to rise reaching severe levels. By the time I made my doctor appointment  I was convinced I had colon cancer. I mean my stool was now fluctuating between loose yellow stool or rock hard stool and just tons of mucus and I was now seeing nearly daily red blood when I wiped. My doctor referred me to a GI doc and they decided a colonoscopy was in order.   I had to wait one hellish month for my appointment for the colonoscopy and during that time my digestive system was so messed up  I was even nauseous and retching every morning when I got up. I was a complete non functioning wreck. The day comes for the procedure and I had a panic attack and cried hysterically while waiting. Afterward I was told ALL WAS GOOD! I kid you not only two days after the procedure and the laxatives were out of my system  my stool went completely back to normal. I'm talking the perfect color  perfect consistency  no blood  no yellow  no undigested food  no mucus. It was like nothing ever happened.   I've come to the conclusion I induced IBS through my prolonged and extreme anxiety - Because as soon as my anxiety was under control my digestive system kicked back in to normal.   I suffered through TWO MONTHS of thinking the worst  mentally agonizing every single day  on google  on forums  sinking lower into a crushing depression... When yes I had worrisome/scary symptoms  but there were so many other explanations that didn't immediately lead to the ridiculous level of personal suffering I put myself through.   So final note if you're facing a similar situation that I was - remember anxiety can cause your GI system to go nuts; this is a fact - evaluate your degree of anxiety and if it's very bad  you very well could have IBS from it. See a doctor if you're concerned; that's totally fine and responsible but also try to work on lowering your anxiety and see if that makes a difference too.

This severely heightened my anxiety. I shortly after began to notice a change in the consistency of my stool - looser at times  lots of undigested food  mucus  yellow colored  always wiping yellow. I decided to wait three weeks to just see if it was a bug my system was working out  but meanwhile my anxiety continued to rise reaching severe levels. By the time I made my doctor appointment  I was convinced I had colon cancer. I mean my stool was now fluctuating between loose yellow stool or rock hard stool and just tons of mucus and I was now seeing nearly daily red blood when I wiped. My doctor referred me to a GI doc and they decided a colonoscopy was in order.   I had to wait one hellish month for my appointment for the colonoscopy and during that time my digestive system was so messed up  I was even nauseous and retching every morning when I got up. I was a complete non functioning wreck. The day comes for the procedure and I had a panic attack and cried hysterically while waiting. Afterward I was told ALL WAS GOOD!

I'm talking the perfect color  perfect consistency  no blood  no yellow  no undigested food  no mucus. It was like nothing ever happened.   I've come to the conclusion I induced IBS through my prolonged and extreme anxiety - Because as soon as my anxiety was under control my digestive system kicked back in to normal.   I suffered through TWO MONTHS of thinking the worst  mentally agonizing every single day  on google  on forums  sinking lower into a crushing depression...

For example people who are exprixnincing lymphoma won’t be able to walk 4 steps or so without running out of breath  you would feel extreme figtugie. Enlarged lymph nodes or just lymph nodes in general are very common  we all have them all around our body just not all of us can feel them.  Lymph nodes work just like an army and they fight off virus  infections etc so you may just be sick in which case it’s actually a healthy sign that ur immune System is working as it should  also if you have been feeling stress lately about anything it can trigger the nodes to be enlarged. I can tell you from a 14 year old boy who was worried it’s nothing to be afraid of  i to jumped  to the conclusion it was cancer but I can almost promise you it was not. Your gp also should have checked to see if you spleen was enlarged and sounding by the result ur gp gave u (telling u to get a ultrasound) confirms my point that there pretty positive there’s nothing wrong with you but the ultra sound is just something to reassure you that nothing is wrong with you.

444,wild_bubbles,Having a major anxiety attack right now :(,Hi all  I’m having an anxiety/panic attack atm. Over the past weeks  I’ve been so stressed about so many things such as school  but most at home. I argue so much with my mom that it gives me a lot of stress and anxiety. I couldn’t eat well because of it and now I have nausea every morning. I’m afraid of getting a heart attack I because of so much stress.   Today I had a huge argument with my mom about something trivial.  It resulted in her insulting me with things about how I’m useless  how I have no purpose  I’m like my dad (dad is out of the picture because of his behavior)  etc. It was so much to the point where I just started biting in tears and hyperventilating. I started having an attack. I told her to stop it  that it wasn’t helping. But she berated me for it  telling me I was being dramatic. I wasn’t. I just started to breakdown because she kept giving me so much crap.  What’s worse is that she told me to kill myself if I wanted to. She brought up my suicidal past from high school too and called me a coward. She just kept going on and on.

445,wild_bubbles,Having a major anxiety attack right now :(,Hi all  I’m having an anxiety/panic attack atm. Over the past weeks  I’ve been so stressed about so many things such as school  but most at home. I argue so much with my mom that it gives me a lot of stress and anxiety. I couldn’t eat well because of it and now I have nausea every morning. I’m afraid of getting a heart attack I because of so much stress.   Today I had a huge argument with my mom about something trivial.  It resulted in her insulting me with things about how I’m useless  how I have no purpose  I’m like my dad (dad is out of the picture because of his behavior)  etc. It was so much to the point where I just started biting in tears and hyperventilating. I started having an attack. I told her to stop it  that it wasn’t helping. But she berated me for it  telling me I was being dramatic. I wasn’t. I just started to breakdown because she kept giving me so much crap.  What’s worse is that she told me to kill myself if I wanted to. She brought up my suicidal past from high school too and called me a coward. She just kept going on and on. Everything just hit me in the head to the point where I just started grabbing my head and panicked more. She threatened to kick me out too.   I don’t have anywhere to go. I don’t have enough money as I work part time and go to school. My chest is hurting so bad I’m worried it’ll actually give me a heart attack from all this stress.  I’m sorry for the venting. I just wanted to let this out.,self,No video,2019-07-13 16:56:32,2.0,7.0,1.0,UponMidnightDreary,I am so sorry you are going through this. Nothing she said was at all acceptable or true and I hope you know that at least cognitively  even though that must all hit hard emotionally.   Do you have any friends you could stay with for a while? If there are any public spaces you can go to be away from her and around other people  that might be an idea too.   I wish I could help you solve everything here  it’s so unfair that you are in this situation.   Short term - you’ve got this. You are stronger than this because you’ve been here before  you know anxiety  you know the dark thoughts and you have overcome them before so you know you can do it again. It will ebb and you WILL come out the other side again.   Long term - if you are looking for resources to help you get out of living with your mother I would suggest starting with your local library. They can help let you know about local services like food banks (if you think you could swing an apartment somewhere but not food too  for example)  health insurance if you don’t have it  cheaper mental health resources if you feel like pursuing that route  etc. (source: I have a library science degree  this is literally what we are here for! Helping people connect with information and resources). Oh! I don’t know your age but if you aren’t old enough to have moving out apply  asking councilors at school can often help kickstart finding resources as well.   I hope things start looking up for you immediately and in the long term. The general system of the world is stacked against so many people and things can be hard - know that it is NOT your fault in any way! Going through these kinds of things is so unfun but it can give the gift of empathy - I’m sure you’re a good and kind person and I wish you all the best. 💕💕💕,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.04567307692307692,16658,

I think that symptoms of a heart attack would be more clear like severe chest pain  vomiting  etc. Plus it is very rare for someone under age 50 to have a heart attack  especially if you arent overweight  dont smoke  and dont have high blood pressure or high cholesterol.   Edit: If you are worried about digestive problems or heart attacks or both  try eating a more whole-food plant-based diet! Lean meats  vegetables  whole grains  fruits.

Maybe I didn’t get all those body ache symptoms but I’ve felt the fear over random symptoms  and I know what it’s like to be afraid of doing things  of living in fear of when the next “attack” will be or what the next symptom will be. I don’t really have any advice to give you besides the obvious of cleaning up your diet and managing stress (we each have our own way of doing that)  but maybe knowing that you’re not alone may help a bit. You know you’re healthy and you know what the chances are of bad things happening. You feel more fear when you get random symptoms because you already have anxiety chemicals in your bloodstream. When you calm down and when you’re having a “good day” you realize how irrational your thinking was. Remember that way of thinking. Stress causes your brain to rewire  but you can also control your “rewiring”. Don’t let your brain make certain negative associations. Don’t let the fear win. It’s all in our heads. It’s our thoughts and fears. There’s nothing wrong with or bodies.

Or seeing that it is not an emergency situation right now  and will most likely be okay to wait  Just remember you are okay  if someone sensed there was something urgently wrong they would help you get help,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.07063492063492062,16673,
461,ihavequestions5678,My health anxiety is ruining my night and no one takes me seriously,I have struggled with health anxiety my whole life  but it’s been out of control ever since going through a traumatic health experience earlier this year.   Today I have convinced myself that I have pelvic inflammatory disease. I have no symptoms other than this ache in my pelvis that has been slowly escalating over the past few months. I made a dr appointment and they can’t see me for another month  and all of the sudden it feels like there will be consequences if I’m not seen by a dr. ASAP. Of course it’s the weekend.   I have already blown up every friend I have (and my mom) via text tonight to the point where they are all so over hearing about it. Now I just feel really alone and anxious about my health. I hate that since I wear my anxiety on my sleeve  no one knows to take me seriously if something is wrong. I hate not being able to differentiate my anxiety from my intuition telling me that something isn’t right. I do know that this pelvic pain is not in my head though  because I have been trying to ignore it for a while now  and it’s getting worse.  I feel like if I ignore it  something bad will happen. I also work all weekend so I’m not sure what my options are as far as going to the dr.,self,No video,2019-07-13 17:32:21,3.0,3.0,2.0,InnerTank,Ha I have a sore lower back   bilaterally sore deltoids   I’m in rough shape.

462,looktotheeeast,Went to the doctor today for my leg and I’m Ok!!!!!,So I’ve been having some soreness in my leg (mostly upper thigh but all over the upper thigh in different places at a time). It’s not pain just soreness. I haven’t been taking any painkillers for it. I’m a huge hypochondriac  and my mind has been racing and making up every scenario. I told my doctor this when I say him and told him I really scared.   I have been worrying and crying over it for like 5 days thinking something is seriously wrong. I’m also about to go on vacation next week so my health anxiety has been flaring up really bad.   So today I went to my family doctor. I was so nervous. I didn’t know what he would tell me  even though everyone in my family was telling me I’m fine and nothing is wrong. I tried very hard to believe people but it wasn’t working so I thought hearing it from a medical professional would help. And this doctor is so good and has diagnosed me well each and every time I’ve went to him/has great bedside manner.   So I went to him and explained my situation in detail. I felt really comfortable but terrified. I’m surprised I didn’t cry in front of him lol. But he asked all necessary questions (have you been wearing a new shoe?/any exercise you’ve done that could have caused this?/are you really active?)   he did a physical exam by just feeling around the area and said everything is okay and even made me do an exercise thing where I hold my foot behind my back. he concluded that this is a muscle strain and that everything is okay. he also said these kind of strains just happen from everyday activities (maybe you walked up the stairs to fast/got out of the car in a weird way/walked your dog too much). He said it takes time to go away and that with them and rest it will. Also recommended that I ice and heat compression it  and maybe take an Advil or ibuprofen if need be.   I feel much better. And my entire family knows this doctor and trusts him. But I was so scared to see a doctor and I did it!!! I’m so glad I did it.

But this pulling/sore sensation is what I told him I was feeling initially. like how you feel after a really intense workout.   where in your calf do you feel this pain  if I may ask?   and thank you so much for your kind words! wishing you all the peace of mind and good health in the world! x,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.21180555555555555,16686,

499,HypoKHAAANdriac,The Most Idiotic Bout of Health Anxiety I have Ever Experienced,"About one hour ago  at about 1:30 AM  I went outside to walk my dog. While he was sniffing some grass I raised my left hand to scratch my ear. As I did so  SOMETHING  almost certainly a bug  smacked right into the back of my hand. I felt it  it made a sound like ""bzzor "" and was gone. I reflexively lowered my hand but saw nothing  I saw nothing on the sidewalk  nothing at all.  *So my brain immediately decided that it was a rabid bat that hit my hand  bit it  and left in less than a second  and that I am thus infected with rabies.*  Even typing it out sounds idiotic. But it's a notion firmly implanted in my subconscious  and I can now feel my body focusing on the back of my hand with all its power. There is no pain. There is no wound. But by god is my body terrified of the back of my hand. It almost feels like I want to cut it off at the wrist just to be safe.

My head was fine but was like?!? Can I die from some kind of bird disease transmitted by its claws ??  My advice is  say it to someone you love who takes your anxiety seriously but can also laugh about it if it's really off - this helps me a lot when I know it's a dumb fear but feel it anyway  laughing is infectious,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.2017857142857143,16712,0.178

502,PestoPastaPenne18,Heart attack/diabetes fear,I’m pre-diabetic and have been for more than a decade. However it’s said to go away if I loose weight which I’m managing. I have this odd fear tonight that I’ll become diabetic and die of a heart attack from the amount of sugar I had today (which really wasn’t THAT much considering what I usually do...). My doctor told me I can’t be diabetic because my A1C was normal last year (sadly he couldn’t check it recently) and that it can’t drop that dramatically unless I gained a significant amount of weight. I did gain a lot this year and last but I managed to stay within the same 20-25 pound range and have lost as often as I gained and never gained too much in a small amount of time. Sadly I’m gaining again but I’m trying to bring it down once more   I had a weird episode last month where most likely due to severe lack of sugar  I had severe shivering that last an entire night. This started the fear but he told me it was a hypoglycemic episode and my cousin who works in the medical field  reassured me of that. Still nervous  anyone wanna comfort me with facts?  This is also because my heart started racing after dinner  more specifically after I drank this apple cider vinegar concoction,self,No video,2019-07-13 13:56:16,1.0,3.0,0.0,SOS_NeXuS_88,It's really easy to reverse prediabetes if i was you i wouldn't worry about getting diabetes as long as you start making some changes to your diet.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.19166666666666668,16715,0.0

It's not really a pain  but it's there. I did the worst thing I could possibly do and googled it as y'all know that didn't help. How do you deal with these thoughts?

I think it’s fair to say that googling symptoms makes the problem worse. Second (and I know this is easier said than done) but the more you think about the pain and what it could be and the more anxious you get  the more intense the pain will feel. I think it’s called psychosomatic anxiety ? You’re body is obviously processing change and needs time to heal. If the pressure is still there within a week  maybe see a doctor about it to relieve some anxiety. But  the most rational answer is that it is your body recovering,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.22916666666666666,16724,0.324
512,Axiomaticuncertainty,Mandibular Lump,I've had a small lump on my left mandible for ~7 months and have had two checkups and countless anxiety attacks about/over it. It's hard but can only be felt with my tongue and seems semi-moveable. My dentist has said that it's not cancerous  but he can't actually feel it and claims that it's a part of the connective tissue. Occasionally  it'll flip sideways as if it's on a sort of hinge. It causes no pain and seems to have grown during the period for which I've known of it. At the same time  I wonder if my obsessive (90% of the day) fiddling with it has led to said growth.  Thoughts? It's ruining my life.,self,No video,2019-07-13 18:09:24,0.0,1.0,0.0,,,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.0,16725,0.004
