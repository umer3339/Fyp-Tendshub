The guide is a trifold pamphlet with 5 recipes and a grocery list that totals under $50 a week(less if utilizing a SNAP program). The last ones I made came out to $36 in total groceries.  The recipes are vegetable heavy  colorful (eat a rainbow)  mention non-meat protein alternatives  are 6 steps or less and can be made using bare minimums....I've made all the recipes on a hot plate.  The guide has price estimates for the surrounding resources  mentions the local SNAP benefits and we include other tips on eating healthy the lazy way such as sheet pan meals or one pot pastas.  I'm working with a dietitian to work on culture conducive recipes and set guides for different communities. The guide is something I do myself as I'm not paid the best but I refuse to eat crap food.

I asked 200 people using cannabis for sleep for granular data on their typical daily cannabis use pattern. We identified a few older folks (70+) who used edibles (2.5 or 10mg gummies or chocolates) exclusively and they told us that they ""used it about an hour before trying to sleep because they didn't want to feel high"". The other patterns I see involve pain vs anxiety where frequency and timing of dose are related to the outcomes.  I truly hope that you asked about sleep!   Also  if you're still collecting data  ask about sex. I was approached a few times after giving talks on cannabis and sleep and asked ""how do you know that people are using cannabis for sleep and not for sex?"" So I did  I have results from about 50 people  2/3 frequent cannabis users  who I asked an open ended question; ""Please tell me how cannabis effects your sexual experience"". I asked more than just that but THAT question generated about 80% positive descriptions (qualitatively) of the participants perceptions of what aspects of their sexual experience were effected. The top hits were ""empathy/intimacy""  ""stronger orgasm"" and ""reduced anxiety"" and these were all adults  typically 40+ so if your home care patients are still having relations with their significant others then this might be a thing you'll see.

The main focus of this project is on cancer and health disparities  I just got a bunch of data from the state BRFFS that's broken down by race and other strata as the public information is just total. I could potentially pm/email you the spreadsheet as it is right now  but it's a little messy and doesn't have that broken down data yet  just general. Most of the rates of things tend to be around the same as the rest of the state with just marginal higher or number numbers (although I haven't compared the BRFFS data to the rest of the state  only Louisville  but for things like cancer incidence and mortality I have it charted with the rest of the state and the country)  however one thing that really jumped out to me is there is a way higher number of STIs in Louisville than the rest of the state. For example  the chlamydia incidence rate in Louisville is around 687 per 100 000 vs 400 per 100 000 for the rest of the state. ,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.00851284958427815,18454,

At first I was a bit skeptical because of the fact that it's online and not the most competitive program  but hey those were the cards I was dealt. It was reassuring to see other highly educated people as classmates because it kind of confirmed to me that if they're going to school in an online program then it can't be that bad after all lol  and it hasn't!  It is a bit pricey  however  being that it is a private school. I believe for the dual degree program it comes out to about $63k in total.

My advice would to be network your ass off right now. Do informational interviews just to find out what people’s jobs are like. Volunteer at a local public health agency (Denver  Jefferson county  tri county  boulder) in a field you like so that if an entry level job comes up they know and respect you and you’re more likely to get the job. Send emails to people (that you found online on their webpages) asking to grab coffee and talk about what they do and your interest in their topic area. Don’t wait to graduate until you do this!!!

The other pro is that you have the option of moonlighting during residency.   The third pro I thought of may depend on your situation: with an MPH under your belt before med school  you have something to apply your medical knowledge to.   And lastly  if you decide that the loans from med school are too much to bear  you already have a certificate that allows you to earn a living. ,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",-0.05198412698412698,18465,

I will say try for a county job and ask your supervisor about ways you can expand your responsibilities. Push ideas that you crowd sourced with other departments to make things easier for everyone. Find creative solutions for things you find redundant or costly. Work smart not work hard. This works well in just about any field.  This opens doors to new pursuits and shows you are willing to go above and beyond but aren't a slave to someone else. I actively pursue extra responsibilities and ask members of other departments if I pick up any slack for them not for their sake but for me to get more skills and develope a system that works better from my perspective. It's tough work but it makes you look great to your supervisor (especially if it makes them look good) and to your resume.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.12298739272423485,18478,

I’m currently a stay at home mom with an arts and writing background. I’ve been very interested in going back for a masters. I’ve been taking free online courses and reading books about biostatistics and epidemiology.    I’ve been on the fence about when to jump start taking prerequisite classes and going back to school. If there were 20-30 hour jobs I feel like I could go back sooner than later  but am conflicted about what to do with my small children.    So I guess my question is do you feel like there are opportunities in the field for 20-30 hour work weeks? I haven’t seen a lot in my area (Bay Area)  but perhaps I’m not looking in the right places? If these don’t exist then maybe I’ll wait till the kids are older.    Thank you for any feedback!

The MPH programs all ask for ""public health experience"" and I'm not entirely sure that I qualify (it's all very social worky/counselling stuff) . Some of my experiences include:  1 year working with youth with disabilities in a pre-employment program. Work ranged from finding volunteer opportunities  leading/designing money management/self regulation classes  and supervising youth with disabilities at their job sites. Have generally worked with youth with disabilities a lot  also worked as BI and tutored kids with autism and LD's.   Volunteering for a women's crisis centre: 500 hours on the crisis line assisting women who have experienced domestic violence/sexual assault and connecting them to services.  Volunteering for local non-profit in harm reduction (1 year)  My questions are:  Could these experiences qualify as public health experience  and if not  what can I do in the next year to make myself a better candidate?  Are there many job opportunities for an MPH in Canada? I've heard the market is relatively swamped.  Any recommendations on an MPH vs. an MSW? While I have really enjoyed the direct frontline aspect of social work  I am interested in the more macro  organizational side of SW  and have been told an Mph might be a better fit for me.

I'm going to University of Houston but their Health degree doesn't match anything I want.  I'm accepted to UTSA and their [BS(Epidemiology and Disease Control) degree](http://catalog.utsa.edu/undergraduate/liberalfinearts/sociology/#publichealth_edc_conc) but I can't find anything on the degree or any sort of outlook. I'm also already accepted into Texas A&M's Entomology which does interest me. In fact  they have an undergrad certificate for [Public Health Entomology](https://entomology.tamu.edu/entomology-academic-program/public-health-entomology/).   So I guess my question is what would you lean towards here? If EIS/Field Epidemiology is my final goal  is Entomology **TOO** specific? Is the UTSA degree no specific enough?

If this is the wrong place to post  sorry!  I was wondering what an Undergraduate in Microbiology should do about getting a job in 'field' epidemiology  or some hands on job in infectious disease control? Ideally something that's a 'first response' on the ground type thing  or is this not possible for non-medics?  For some background  I'm graduating this year in Microbiology from a Russel group university in the UK  making applications for a Masters (LSHTM hopefully) and was wondering what I should be applying for. Would it be possible to go the MPH route and then onto a PhD in something more specific?  Thank you for any help!,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.065625,18503,

I'm in a particularly odd predicament because I am currently in a job that I want to continue with. However  I am not seeing how I can both keep my job and dedicate 24 hours a week to an internship. Once I graduate I will have been in over three years at this place in various positions and I just do not want to leave. I have feel like I have gained everything from this job (and more!) that an internship could possibly offer. I would be willing to do ANYTHING to get this waived including extra classes or providing documentation from colleagues or even other organizations I have developed relationships with. The other issues is I do three people who depend on my income  and a paid internship will not make enough for us to sustain ourselves. I am just feeling so stuck!

I will have 2 national conference poster presentations  1 university level oral presentation and 1 world conference presentation. Additionally I will be authored in roughly 6-8 papers based on the research in the coming years  but won't be published by the time I am applying. I do have one publication in a clinical journal. * I am a STI test counselor at my university * Still need to do the GRE but not super worried about it...also will have an MCAT score by application time  So I am looking at the top tier schools: Harvard and Johns Hopkins (would have to MSPH there)  Uwash  Emory  Michigan  Berkeley  BU  Minnesota  Tulane and Columbia.

I am set to take my CHES exam in April and have a fair amount of experience leading groups and individual educations. I am currently a key member of a pilot program partnered into the county government in the suburbs helping low income clients.   I will be looking to go into some statistical items such as SAS and R (maybe some GIS if I can find any good teachings on it) because I live in the DC metro area they are very prominent here. This is all before I've even consider jumping into the grad school idea (still paying off loans and don't know what I want to do). So I have a few questions...  1.) What are some good ways for me to gain some SAS and R knowledge? I did decently well in statistics in highschool and college and have experience using minitab and SPSS as well as extensive use in Excel.   2.) I am weighing tracks between epidemiology  behavioral health and health promotion/communication but am not even sure on those yet....I know I'm a mess. What are some good places or titles to look at for these and what can I do to break into epi?  3.) What are some lesser known places in the DC area that might be interesting for a public health nerd to look at for work? I am thinking about moving into the city because my significant others job is in the heart of DC.  4.) Anything else that might be helpful?  Thanks for any and all answers  I love this community despite it being fairly small or at least less trafficked on Reddit. ,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.21986531986531987,18512,

I have a psych degree from a UC with a 3.8  and 3 years of college volunteer/work experience with sexual health education  informal counseling  and sexual violence prevention education (I presented to thousands of incoming students). One of those years I was the Chancellor's Undergraduate Intern for sex ed outreach and coordination  I created successful events from the ground up including my first year as a volunteer  and did many workshops I wrote myself. I became known as really hard worker and a trusted resource at my center  and my supervisor at this job was very proud of the nuanced work I did and allowed me the room to do projects largely by myself. I have also done 8 months of kink and fetish research at uni.   &#x200B;  I thought this experience would be enough for a decent sex ed job. I graduated last year and got a shit job that lied about the position  where all my projects  are dead ends and my skills aren't valued  and it's stagnating my career and making me depressed. I'm not sure if I should do an MPH in Community Health Education that will only have 2-4 relevant classes to me (including practicum)  a $7-15 000 sexual health grad certificate  a $7 000 AASECT-approved sexual health certification  or a $700 comprehensive certificate (not certification) program.

I am a physician (Internal Medicine) working for the federal government right now and I am looking to get into public health as a career. I'm interested in epidemiology and outbreak investigations  and in a lesser way  public health policy. My dream job would be working at either the WHO or the CDC in disease eradication/global  health.   I am getting a lot of acceptance to schools (more than I expected) and am not sure who to choose. I have been accepted to:  \- University of Maryland  MPH in Public Health Practice and Policy  \- George Mason University  MPH in Public Health Practice   \- University of South Florida  MPH in Epidemiology  Still waiting to hear from SUNY-Albany  EVMS and University of Florida.   I was originally leaning heavily on South Florida because of the cheap tuition ($525 per credit hour or $22 100 for 42 credit hours) but I'm concerned about the job market and how easily it is to break into the field and that makes me lean towards Maryland  which while more expensive ($836 per credit hour or $35 100 for 42 credits) seems to be more ""famous"" than South Florida and likely have more of an alumni penetration in the health agencies around DC/North Bethesda (HRSA  FDA  NIH  etc.)   George Mason I'm neutral about.   Any advice? Have any of you heard of particular strengths in those programs that I may be overlooking? Is ""name recognition"" important at all in public health practice and the job market?

I have worked with different softwares (SPSS  R  etc)  I suppose my biggest concern is my lack of skill in calculus. I have taken various courses in statistics  but calculus scares the life out of me. I’m considering taking a calc course at my local community college over the summer as a refresher and to build confidence. For all those who are currently in/were in an MPH for biostat/epi  do you think your program was calculus heavy?  Thank you in advance! ,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.1375,18531,

I like this part-time job and don't want to quit it any time soon. I've noticed that there's a lot of room for advancement in this organization  so I think it's a good fit for me.

I'm especially focused on substance use  but that might be too specific.  ​  Is it too early to look at specific schools? I live next to the University of Washington  but I've also spoken with an epidemiologist at UC Denver who does work on my pet topic. He mentioned that if someone like me applied he would push for getting them admitted and able to work with him on his research. (Epidemiology doesn't seem as appealing to me though  and I don't want these to be empty promises.)  ​  Right now though I think it would be best for me to narrow down what kind of MPH subfield I should study in. I am pretty sure that epidemiology is not for me. I would like to continue in a subfield more connected to anthropology  since that is my passion.

So i have several questions. (1) How do I delay the first so I can wait to hear from the other two  or should I call the other two and ask for an update? (2) If I were to be offered all three I am still really unsure of what I would pick  not only because of the funding/paid part but also because of the very different work each experience would provide me with  so any advice would be incredible!!

I've been given the opportunity to switch into a dual degree program and graduate with my MPH  global health certificate and a Masters in International Development. However  it'll take a little more time to get MPH/MID than it would be for me to get just my MPH. Would having an MID help distinguish myself more from other applicants? I feel like the areas I really want to work in are pretty heavily saturated with applicants and I've been debating whether I should go the Phd route and this seems like it might be a good alternative and I'd be out of school a LOT sooner.   &#x200B;  &#x200B;  (It would mean being full time all next year  and adding on one additional semester),,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.11911764705882352,18547,

I've scheduled a meeting with a researcher who does really interesting research to potentially serve as my supervisor for some supervised research credits.

I work full time so an online school would be optimal. Fortunately it seems like there are many programs that offer online classes  but I would like to know which schools are the most helpful.   2) I received my bachelors degree in 2010 in elementary education. I have been owning a licensed childcare center since then but I want to get my masters in something that isn’t childcare. Do you think it would matter to prospective employers that my BA degree/work experience isn’t related to science  health  tech etc. at all? This is my main worry.

I am interested in working at the CDC in a BSL-4 working with infectious disease (viruses &prions in particular)  but am minoring in global health and really enjoy those classes. I had my heart set on a PhD just because it seemed pretty straightforward in that I wanted to do research and that's typically what you need to do research  but I currently work in an academic lab and am second guessing how much I like lab work (though that could be because I'm not particularly interested in the day-to-day tasks). I really enjoy working with people  so now I'm thinking of still working in a BSL-4 at the CDC  but doing some field work (if that's even possible).  The one thing that is setting me off about the MPH/MsPH route is just the money aspect of it  though I do enjoy that it is a much shorter program that a PhD. Also  I would most likely be getting my PhD related to more bio/infectious diseases than public health  so I wouldn't need a Masters to apply/be accepted so it seems like a waste if I were to eventually go for a PhD.

About a third of the way through my MPH  and — I’m scared I picked the wrong school. Don’t get me wrong. I think the education is solid. But they’re in the process of becoming CEPH accredited. I’ve been told that once they are  it will be retroactively applies to people who’ve already graduated. But accreditation can take around three years. I’ll graduate in less than two.   So here’s the question — is it a make or break accreditation? I ask because I was looking at CDC fellowships the other day and they won’t even look at you if your school isn’t CEPH. Is that a standard opinion in the field?   Thanks!,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",-0.06574074074074074,18561,

However  Columbia Mailman is one of my dream schools and I am considering applying for the certificate program or just taking some courses there to boost my gpa and show I'm capable of doing well in my classes. Biotechnology is the closest available certificate (the others are business  classics  etc.) but idk if that makes sense with what I want to do: interested in healthcare policy analysis  but also looking into epi for doh/government. So otherwise  I'd sign up for individual classes  but I'm not quite sure what courses to take that would best help my application either (max I can afford is like 2\~3 courses atm).  If anyone has any experience with this & could share recommendations I'd be very grateful!

I also just interviewed a few weeks ago for the CDC’s PHAP program.   Overall  I feel like PHAP is way more competitive to get than getting into an MPH program. I’m conflicted right now on which do  assuming I get placed somewhere for PHAP in July.   I’m going to a top 10 school for my MPH but I do feel like if I did PHAP first I’d be able to get into Hopkins for my MPH and then easily become a CDC public health advisor later.   PHAP would place me at a local or state health department or an NGO. I’ve actually already had internships at a local and state health department in two different states so while I know the experience would be valuable I’m wondering if it would be different enough to justify choosing more experience over education.   I’m also thinking about going to PA school after my MPH so that would be a completely different route but I might be able to get patient care hours at my PHAP placement.

Thus  I have been looking at other career options  and one that looked like I might be qualified for was a trainee EHS in the state of CA. I am really open to working anywhere  I just happened upon the CA listing. I have taken a lot of basic science courses (Bio  Chem  Physics  soil science  etc.) and many courses that where focused on aquatic health and systems  in addition to interacting with stakeholder groups (the public). I have also taken an advanced course in toxicology  though it was focused on fishes. I also have a shitload of experience working in the field doing investigative science  albeit in the fisheries realm. Can anyone let me know if I might be qualified for this position  or if I might just have to take a few more classes to qualify? I would be happy to send my CV/transcripts to someone to look at all the specifics if necessary.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.15267857142857144,18581,

You should market yourself as someone who has experience working with patients/working in a hospital setting/working in the field.

I looked at the EIS Class of 2016 profiles when I went through the Annual EIS Conference program for this last year and I did a quick breakdown of their degrees.  For the EIS Class of 2016  there were:  · MD/DOs: 14  · MD  MPH: 17  · RN/MPH: 1  · Ph.D: 4  · Ph.D  MPH: 19  · Ph.D  other Master's degree: 4  · DVM  MPH: 6  · DVM  other Master's degree: 1  · DVM  MPH  Ph.D: 1  · DVM  Ph.D: 1  · Dr. Ph: 2  · other degrees: 2  · MPH  other Master's degree: 1  · total: 78  Of the 78 officers  46% were physicians and 76% of them had a MPH. They do take veterinarians but they seem to really lean towards generalists when picking officers. It also looks to be really hard to get into EIS with just an MPH. While having an MPH seems almost like a prerequisite you also need another degree.

I don't mean this in a mean way  but from the master's students- the people on the pre med track seem to separate themselves pretty easily as the top students. I think the people coming from higher ranking state schools have also found the program to be much more manageable than people coming from a small private school. You sound quite ambitious and I think that you will get into a top program based off of what you told me. What I love about the program here is that despite being a top school  it's not insanely competitive. It's collaborative- people aren't out to get you at all and the entire masters program is pass/fail  so the emphasis is really on learning the material than competing for a grade. I take it that you're interested on epi from your background? and probably why you didn't list Gillings on there because we only have epi PHDs. From my experience  the rigor and pedigree of applicants tends to be a level above for epi/biostats/environmental science compared to larger departments like health behavior or health leadership  but again I can only speak for UNC and where my friends are attending. Let me know your departmental interest or shoot me a pm if you want to know any more info. UNC also has competitive tuition and you can qualify for in state after a year if you do decide to apply.

These can all be accomplished with a masters level education. The PhD gives you the skillset necessary to plan out your own research  become the principal investigator  and lead teams. Most leadership positions in the field will be filled with people with a doctorate. The most common advice is to work for a few years before pursuing the PhD - it's not for everyone.  The contract research organization industry is heavily fragmented  there aren't any I can think of which have a large international presence. Most cater to a specific type of research  like small molecule or biomedical 510ks. There is a continuing trend for R&D to be outsourced  so the sector is growing  and I expect consolidation will generate some larger names in the near future.  Don't stress about positions.

Right there with ya  friend. Have you thought about getting a full-time job at a local health department or advocacy groups in your area (or other areas you would like to live in) rather than applying for schools? I think that is also another alternative route you should be keeping in mind.  &#x200B;  I am hesitant of making recommendations for schools (specifically for environmental health) because I don't know too much about different schools' programs.  In terms of concentrations  I think epidemiology or environmental science are both great concentrations that align with your interest. I know several epidemiologists in my school study issues in climate change how that affects health.  &#x200B;  When searching for programs to attend  don't hesitate to look at courses offered the the program AND other programs (policy school  dept. of econ  etc). For example  I recently learned the Policy School at my university offers a class in the Fall where they send students to DC for a conference related to climate change. That sounds pretty cool.  &#x200B;  Hope this helps!,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.15997362012987015,18645,

I would say I am glad I accepted the offer. I had already accepted an offer at the University of Illinois in Chicago  I turned down the offer and accepted NYU’s because I received a partial scholarship of about $20 000 and I would be living in the big apple. At first  I was all excited about moving out to the big city and starting my public health career  I tried to research about the program  but to be honest there was not much out there about the program. It was fairly new  which was a little concerning. Like you  I was most concerned about the job prospects  especially after the program was completed. I asked myself  what kind of jobs do students who go through the program get? Where would I end up?  One thing I had not taken into account was the cost of living in NYC. The Scholarship barely put a dent in my expenses  to be brutally honest NYU is an expensive school. But what it lacks in affordability  it makes up in endless opportunities. My idea of school NYU was that the NYU name would get me the Job offer. But the truth is that  while the NYU name may get you to the table  you need to put in the work  you need to sell yourself  you need to design your story that sets you apart from the other 2 000 applicants applying for that one position  and I learned this by utilizing the resources at NYU. The problem with most graduate students that enter master programs straight from undergrad  is that we expect that our school/ colleges will create opportunities for us. I was in a similar school of thought  but the truth is  I had to realize that I needed to leverage the resources  tools  and relationships available at NYU to create opportunities for myself. This is the reality in all graduate school be it Harvard  Yale or the University of Phoenix. You need to create your own opportunities. It will not be spoon fed to you neither will it be presented to you on a platter of Gold. The great thing about NYU GPH is that there are a ton of resources at your disposal and the most valuable of them all are the faculty. I was able to build a relationships and network with GPH’s faculty and through this I completed two internships at reputable NGO’s  I was part of a lab at NYU Langone health (medical school)  I completed a study abroad course in Italy with migrant refugees  completed field work on vaccine safety in the northern region of Ghana and presented an oral abstract at one of the most prestigious public health conferences in the nation (APHA). In my two years at NYU  I experienced so many incredible opportunities  I would otherwise not have gained at a different college. This was only possible because of the resources at my disposal at NYU. Two key resources were the relationships I built with faculty and the resources at NYU Wasserman Career center. Through the career center  I was able to sit down with a career specialist who helped me revise my cover letter and resume and offered sessions for mock interviews and opportunities to learn how to negotiate. I learned a lot about job hunting  applying  utilizing LinkedIn and best interviewing practices  etc. The truth is that it is 20% applying and 80% networking (i.e. building relationships). These opportunities were only available to me because 1) I was at NYU 2) I actively sought out these opportunities. To cut a long story short  I was able to get a job offer  through my internship at a lab  in my area of specialty (global health)  with an above average salary (with room to grow of course)  before graduated from NYU. This was only possible through networking with faculty  leveraging existing relationships at NYU. And I can boldly say I am so happy I chose NYU. If I went to CUNY or some other school  would I have a job? The answer is probably yes. But would the job be exactly in global health  in a city of great opportunity and with a sustainable income  with room to grow? Most likely NO!   NYU gets you to the table  but your hard work and dedication are what gets you the JOB! Besides my student loans (which we all have)  I have ZERO regrets.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.19343337218337225,18646,

My school happens to have a survey research center where I began working senior year. See if your school has any type of sociological research programs  or clinical research that deals with patient interaction. Also perhaps check for internships with local hospitals or health departments. 2. My public health curriculum included basic science classes  statistics  research methods  and health psychology/sociology. 3.  I found the flow chart to be very helpful- I originated in Social Behavioral Health Sciences because it was the most related to my survey research job  but later was going to switch to Health Systems and Policy because I don't want to be a health educator. Some schools allow you to double-major which is what I did so I didn't have to choose. Also keep in mind the concentration does not force you into only one career path. 4. I didn't study for the GRE and took it fall of my senior year. I would recommend taking it slightly earlier in case you need to retake it  depending on when your applications are due  LMK if you have any more questions!,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.08717948717948718,18654,

That will definitely help with finding a job. If you have been casting your net wide and applying to a variety of entry level positions  you should be hearing back for an initial interview. If feel like you’ve applied to many position and still haven’t heard anything your resume/CV might need some work. Take time to tailor it to each position you apply to. Often times it’s not your potential boss that sees your application first but rather an HR rep scanning for key-words.   The other issue could be that you’re not applying to enough positions. Applying to Epi related positions in Environmental Health  Chronic Disease Epi  etc. most large county/state health departments hire Epi positions in many of their divisions. Infectious disease Epi seems to be the most popular area of Epi research for recent graduates at the moment (and may or may not be more difficult to find work in  I don’t know) but getting your foot in the door in an Environmental Health position could help your transition to Infectious disease research if that’s what your goal is.

Maternal and Child Health is a very important topic in public health and child care providers serve a major role in the development of the children they serve. Child care providers can institute healthy menu requirements  healthy policies around food  screen time  physical activity  etc.  and family engagement activities around health topics. All of these areas can have a major impact on the childhood obesity rates in this country. Your level of dedication to the health of these children can lay a foundation of positive health habits that may persist into adulthood. Your work as a child care provider could easily be interpreted as public health work despite not being a hard science background.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.16782828282828285,18660,

I literally set up phone calls with each faculty member to tell them i was applying  interested in their research  this is my background  if accepted do you think is is feasible and a good fit. i talked to some real assholes that i would never want to work with but were at the top of my list before talking with them. it isn't a professional degree like an MPH  it is an academic  research focused degree. i HIGHLY recommend working for at least a year to think about if you truly want to go the PhD route. It pigeon holes you into a specific topic area and largely academic roles  because you become an expert in your research.      i didn't apply for a lot of reasons  but what i finally realized is that i equated a PhD with self worth and success. i wanted a PhD to have a PhD  not because i needed one. I had a job i hated and it was the light at the end of the tunnel.

I had some really traumatic personal events happen back to back over the course of one year in undergrad and I tanked my GPA and had all W's for one semester. I graduated with a 2.6 cumulative (I know  yikes) but I kicked ass on the GRE. I earned my BS in health science/public health and vaguely knew the department chair  and let him know I applied to the program.   &#x200B;  I got a phone call a few weeks later saying they liked my app but were worried about my GPA. I told them about my situation and they said they may ask me to write a letter explaining everything but would get back to me. I was conditionally admitted  meaning I had to keep my GPA above 3.5 for a few semesters. I'm graduating with my MPH in August and my GPA is 3.71.  &#x200B;  Some programs focus on holistic admissions  meaning they look at more than your GPA and testing scores. But it depends on the program. If your current institution offers the degree I'd encourage you to apply there as well  because your letters of recommendation from professors you already know there could give you a leg up. ,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.03333333333333333,18693,

I think it was in undergrad that I became very enamored with public health. I loved to read books about human biology  medicine and evolution but my favorite books were always about outbreaks and epidemics like The Hot Zone  Demon in the Freezer  The Coming Plague  And the Band Played On  etc.   I was fascinated with how disease moved through a population and how our cultural and religious practices can unwittingly exacerbate the incidence and prevalence of different diseases. I was also a sociology minor so at the same time I was learning about social movements  patterns of human behavior in societies and social policy. So in the end it was clear that public health was the only field that combined my love for human biology and social policy and study.   >I'm currently deciding between going to medical school and public health school  both of which I've been accepted into. It's not an easy decision for multiple reasons.  I hear you...I think it depends on what you want to do. If you're sure you want to work with population health I would go to public health school. If you want to keep your options open then medical school keeps the option open for the future.   I definitely regret going to medical school. I racked up enormous debt ($200k plus) and spent 3 years after medical school getting humiliated and burn out in the wards of a tertiary medical center just so to have to go back to school to get an MPH lol.  From the beginning I knew that I would never enjoy working in a hospital or in a clinic so I should've just bit the bullet but it was likely too late to change course by 3rd year of medical school.   But if I could go back I would get my MPH and a Ph.D. in epidemiology. I would be in the middle of my public health career right now instead of switching focus in my mid-30s.   My advice: try to shadow professionals in both fields. Get a real taste for the type of work they do. Shadow a surgeon or an internist in a busy hospital or clinic and then shadow an epidemiologist in a health department .  >Also  have you considered a fellowship in preventive medicine? You get your MPH paid for and its a perfect launchpad for programs like EIS which in turn is a fantastic ""in"" for the CDC. With you background in internal medicine you would be very well set for a career with the CDC.  I actually applied to prev medicine this last fall and was totally unsuccessful haha. I guess I was nowhere near as competitive as I thought. I'll probably try again this fall but I can't wait around forever so I'm biting the bullet and starting the MPH.   EIS was my dream...but I'm not sure I'm competitive right now. I looked up the stats for the EIS Class of 2016 and 80% of their entering class had an MPH. At least 30-40% had a Ph.D. or an MD as well. So I gotta step up my game to apply.   >In terms of name recognition  I definitely don't think that its that important for given your education level. However  if someone were to rely on the MPH (without the MD) for either job or PHD acceptances  the name and reputation really does matter. A lot of people get MPH's so its important to stand out. With your MD and residency experience you already stand out quite a bit.  I hear you. Thanks for the advice. I think I'll go to Maryland: it's closer to me so I can maybe drive up and get some face to face with mentors and stuff and I hear the local HHS agencies in North Bethesda (HRSA  FDA  NIH) really like Maryland MPH grads.",,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.09545739348370927,18723,

I know I’m still a few years away from even applying but I was curious as to what other credentials/experience I should try for in order to make myself the best candidate I can be.

However  being an EIS officer is a great way to get into a good position in public health at government agencies (state agencies  CDC  etc.). It also isn't the be-all-end-all of fellowships. It's prestigious (especially within the CDC)  but there are also other post-doctoral/post-masters fellowships such as ORISE  CSTE  etc.  But specifically with regards to the EIS  in addition to having a doctoral/clinical/allied health degree  you should make sure you focus your MPH towards epidemiology and quantitative skills. EIS officers get 1 month of in-class training at Emory  but learn most of their skills ""in the field"". Already having a background in epi methods  stats  outbreak investigation would probably help you stand out as someone who has a passion for public health and for applied/field epi.  I also believe you need at least 1 year of public health related work experience *before* you join EIS  but I'm not 100% certain.  And as with any post-degree fellowship  you need to have a strong transcript and good letters of recommendation.",,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.2264136904761905,18784,0.113

I currently have my PharmD and am starting on my MPH this fall.

At that point the faculty or staff member has to remind the student that the EIS is an admirable fellowship  but the student should think beyond those 2 years.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.0,18786,

From what research I’ve done and people I’ve talked to  it really could go either way. Personally I’m very interested in public health law and working at the CDC would be my dream  especially because they have a law associate program specifically for public health law. For attorneys there  it seems like most of them have a dual degree. On the other hand  I currently work at a BigLaw firm as an assistant and I don’t think any of our healthcare partners have a dual degree. In fact  last year one of our litigation partners left to work as in-house counsel for a hospital network  which obviously is more than just health law but still related and he doesn’t even have a huge amount of health law experience. Honestly  it seems like it boils down to what you want to do with it and how much you care about debt. Someone in policy/the public arena would probably use it more often  but for a litigation job it might not be necessary but could open some doors. For me  I not only want the degree to open doors for me and to use day-to-day  but because I also know that MPH classes interest me a lot and will be a welcome “break” from law courses while still being a worthwhile and productive use of my time.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.1617777777777778,18801,

Some people say that it makes you looks wishy washy or indecisive  but I think that’s mostly an “older” way of thinking. Firms are kind of catching up with the realization that having diversified and well-educated attorneys is more important than having robots with the Exact Same Education and the Exact Same Information to spew out. The thing is that either way  you’re getting a law degree. You DO learn that same exact information that everyone else learns whether you go to Yale or Cooley. You take the same bar as the person ranked first in your class and last. Getting your MPH isn’t going to push that information out of your head or make you lose you legal writing skills.  In fact  I think the second degree not only makes a candidate look more appealing than just another J.D.  but I think it makes an individual look like a proactive person willing to a) spend the extra time/money/effort to learn more and b) pursue an interest that only further develops their education. You not only have the same JD as everyone else  but you have this extra degree. They’re both nice on their own  but when you get the chance to use them together then it’s that much more power. If your gut is telling you to do it  then I say listen to it. Do some more research and talk to career services/advising to see if they can connect you to any JD/MPH alumni  just so you feel more prepared to make your decision. But I say that if you want to do it and you don’t have a specific major reason not to  then take this opportunity while you can!,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.22124451754385965,18810,

My undergrad was in health administration  so I can relate to your situation. It's a difficult degree to land a position. You're competing with MPHs  MHAs  and individuals with clinical educations moving into administrative positions. You'll need a definitive value add proposition for any employer and that will require you to differentiate yourself. (I also mentor MPH students  so I'll give you the same advice I give them). The best way to differentiate yourself at this time is through project management certification. There are a number of reasons for this: 1) it's  valuable skill set 2) the hard skill set will offset your soft skills learned through your degree 3) it's popular will many employers.   The certification to pursue is the CAPM through PMI. Also  ASQ has the CIQA certification for entry-level quality improvement which can also be helpful.   The positions you should be looking for are assistant project manager  analyst  associate manager  program manager  or something similar. Depending on where you live those could be hard to come by. If that's the case look for Patient Scheduling  Patient Access  or similar positions in larger health systems. Many of these employers will even help pay for your graduate degree (which you'll eventually need to advance in health administration).   Shoot me a PM if you have questions.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.13484848484848486,18811,0.05

Join the UTSPH Facebook page. So much advice as well as people giving away or selling their textbooks.  Another point is: you get out of it what you put in it. Example: You can get an A in environmental class and not learn a thing. However if you care and want to learn the material  you will put in the work.   Last thing  It’s easier to get a job on campus when you talk and connect with your professors. I was a research assistant while pursuing my MPH.

I would recommend doing that actually. Some of the online classes can be less rigorous and it’ll be a good balance to balance out the difficulty of taking biostats and epi for majors right out the gate  2. My favorite transferred to another university but this really depends. Are there specialties you’re interested in or what makes a professor good in your eyes?  3. I took it on a whim but I really liked Water Environment. The load outside of class was light but the time I spent in class was really valuable. A lot of other folks who wanted to do more infection prevention stuff took a couple electives they really enjoyed for that. I can ask if that’s up your alley  I know at least one does infection prevention now  4. I started off for the first semester going to school full time with no part time job. Then I found a part time job related to the field a bit later and managed it fairly easily. I know a fair number of students do that.

Online classes for electives are a good option  but I would not recommend them for epi or biostats classes throughout your time at UTSPH. It's easier to ask questions and be more engaged with an in-person class and these are the courses that you'll need to pay attention in. It's also good to take these classes in person from a social standpoint since most other people in the epi department will also be taking these courses so you can make connections with classmates. Definitely  take epi 2 in person (it's a survey design course where you have a partner so being there in person makes life much easier). It looks like Bing Yu is teaching epi 1 in the Fall. I had her for epi 1 and liked her. She presents the material in a clear way and if you read the textbook then you shouldn't have any issues (but it never hurts to make friends with the TAs).  2. Also 3. Blake Hansen is great! I think he teaches epi 1 and 3 now. Alfred McAlister teaches courses in the Health Promotion and Behavioral Sciences department  so he might be teaching the core course for that area? He's a character and his class was great! If you like ID stuff  then Lu-Hu Hwang teaches a pass/fail course called Epidemiology and Control of Infectious Diseases. Han Chen teaches a class on R programming in epi and I highly recommend that class too.   I graduated in December 2018  but some of the professors that I had and really liked are no longer there. There's always a lot of turnover in who teaches intro to biostats  so you would need to talk to a current student for insights on that one. You can PM me if you have other questions and I can see about putting you in contact with a friend who is in the PhD program there.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.36520833333333336,18829,

I figured this semester I would do the 3 classes  and gauge if I can handle more or less for Spring 2020.   Personally  a professor who enjoys the content and can explain the content well is a trait I find good in a professor. I've taken a lot of classes in undergrad that were taught by professors who would come into class  give a powerpoint presentation and that was it. They wouldn't even be sure what they were talking about so I had to go back very often and teach it to myself.  I'm not sure if I have a specific route I want to go in epi  so I'm still kind of figuring it out. With that being said  I think disease tracking is really interesting  and to be honest I'm not sure if I would be super interested into going into pure research  but that's just me.

The PhD there was fully funded  all tuition covered. The stipend was like ~$30k/year for 4 years BUT it was a tiny program that only admitted <10 students per year.  I’m of the opinion that you should not pay for a PhD. Also  not surprised that you didn’t get more offers without already having a masters degree. When applying to PhDs  you’re competing against other applicants who do have a masters  and often several years of research experience on top of it  so you have to make an EXTRA compelling case as to why you’re a better investment/gamble than they are. With a masters degree and the extra experience that goes with it  I think you’ll have a lot more luck.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.15892857142857145,18854,0.194

Students should expect to pick up TAs in return  and can pursue RAs for living expenses. Better programs will also offer insurance/dental/vision  and leave-of-absence options. Also common are subsidized funding packages  such as 75% for 4 years  and 50% up to six years. Ultimately  you'll have to decide based on the offers you receive.  If you can manage  the absolute best thing you could do is get on the ground level of a grant  and write yourself a role.

My former university (large R1 state school) limited all RAs/TAs to no more than a 50% appointment while full-time.

My view is that nursing degrees are much more valued both in pay and job opportunities. His starting pay (about 15 years ago) was 2-3X what my starting pay way with a master's. He has an associates. I think nursing is more competitive now than is was then so you probably want more than an associate's. If you want to work in public health a nursing degree should be fine. But if you want to be a nurse an MPH will be useless without also going to nursing school. I would def start with the nursing degree and only consider adding an MPH if you fund not having it is you back. As others gave said get the nursing degree if you want to do clinical work. If you want to be an epidemiologist you will probably want a PhD.  I have an MPH in epidemiology an very few jobs will accept that as enough.

Also  timing is a really big thing. Back before my mom got her job  she was working as a regular nurse in a doctor's office. She's now over emergency preparedness/epi. You can tell they are squashed for resources because she covers 3 different jobs still.      She says that back then  (in the late 90's  early 00's) it was much easier to get a job in epi because no one really heard of it. It wasn't as big as it is now I feel.      There's no doubt that being a nurse has helped her. She was there for many outbreaks  hurricane Katrina  etc. There's just not as much funding anymore. After the hurricane  for example  they had loads to spend on disaster planning with local fire departments  airports.      She's done a bunch of stuff and I'm really jealous  but right now it's kinda flooded. I mean  every time I come on this subreddit  it's people wanting to get into epi about 80% of the time.

So while wealth itself is a strong indicator of health outcomes it's also wealth relative to the poorest in a society and his study showed this correlation worldwide and even state/district/province/citywide. The countries with the lowest rates of income inequality like Sweden and Norway have better health outcomes compared to nations like the United States and the United Kingdom which have high rates of income inequality. Even within the US the there have been studies like in Louisville where they showed a direct correlation between health and wealth among their voting districts. It's a straight line social gradient where even the 2nd wealthiest have slightly worse outcomes than the wealthiest. There is obviously more complexities to it like genetics within a population but there is a strong correlation between wealth and health outcomes.     http://rethinkingprosperity.org/richard-wilkinson-how-economic-inequality-harms-societies/  https://www.kanopy.com/product/sickness-and-wealth,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.12256410256410258,18912,

Thanks for any advice you have.",self,No video,2019-07-09 05:43:47,15.0,16.0,0.0,rius5703,It sounds like you’re asking about how Medicaid and Medicare work. As far as I understand  they are both funded through tax dollars. Medicare is a federal program offered  to people when they retire around age 65 and Medicaid is a state program offered to people who don’t make enough money to purchase private insurance. If you are advocating for a “Medicare for all” policy (more formerly called Universal Healthcare)  there are many way in which a program can be implemented. We are the only high income country that does not offer some form of universal healthcare to our citizens. Some systems work okay  while others work far better. Try reading this NYT article from 2016 which compares healthcare systems from various selected countries (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/09/18/upshot/best-health-care-system-country-bracket.html). France has a particularly interesting setup.   Now in terms of cost  universal health care will be FAR CHEAPER than forcing people to continue to pay for private insurance. Our current system requires people to pay for astronomical monthly premiums  on top of copays  coinsurance  and deductibles. Many people find that their medications aren’t covered by insurance so they end up paying out of pocket for those. Insurance isn’t the only problem in our country though that contributes to the high costs of healthcare. Hospitals have unregulated (someone correct me if I’m wrong here) billing practices. Part of the reason why they submit huge bills to insurance companies is because they know the insurance companies will not usually pay 100% of the bill. So the more they bill  the more likely they will get paid closer to the true cost of care. Inflate the value and hope they meet you at what you really want for the service. There needs to be standards set for billing  like I shouldn’t be able to get two drastically different quotes for an open heart surgery. The cost should be the same across the board.   Hope my insight helps you in some way.  EDIT: I forgot to elaborate on how universal health care would be cheaper. The best example is this: total up all of your costs for health care as our current system exists today. For me  my husband and I pay $300/ mo for our premium  we have a $500 family deductible  no copays  but we pay 15% coinsurance when the insurance company decides a service is covered. So  we pay $3 600 a year in premiums alone plus a $500 deductible puts is out $4 100. We’ve already paid  $1 108 in coinsurance this year. In total  assuming we don’t need to see the doctor anymore this year  we will have paid around $5 200 for health care  and we only make $56 000 a year before taxes and deductions.   Now imagine that to implement universal healthcare  the government will take 2% more taxes from your paycheck. If you make $100 000 annually  that’s only an additional $2 000 for universal healthcare. The vast majority of people in this country do not make a six figure salary.  So what is more cost effective now? Paying 2% more in federal taxes for universal healthcare  or continuing to pay for private health insurance? The universal health care becomes much cheaper  more affordable for all Americans  and it ensures everyone has coverage.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.1908181818181818,18922,0.164

As an epidemiologist the argument that healthy people that live longer cost more  is absolutely not correct. By way of chronic disease alone the Canadian economy takes a [190 billion dollar](https://www.ourcommons.ca/Content/Committee/421/FINA/Brief/BR9073636/br-external/ChronicDiseasePreventionAllianceOfCanada-e.pdf)  hit each year and these figures will continue to grow in every country in the world as long as the prevalence of obesity/diabetes/cardiovascular disease continue to increase.   Having written an entire dissertation on metabolic syndrome  the burden of chronic disease is a growing pandemic that we have no idea how to effectively mitigate. There are several reasons why your point is flawed: 1. Healthy people cost far less even just by looking at healthcare utilization rates alone. 2. Healthy people are more likely to use active transportation  eat less processed garbage  and produce less waste and therefore the overall carbon footprint is reduced. 3. Healthy people yield more positive economic contributions to society through employment and community action. 4. People who are overweight or have cardiovascular disease/diabetes are at far greater risk for a multitude of co-morbidities and as a result are more likely to become disabled. This in turn far surpasses the lifetime cost burden on health care expenditures and social assistance.  I have absolutely no idea where you get your information from but your perception is completely backwards. Your grad program should check some facts. I suggest taking a look at rates of chronic disease  health care expenditures as a result  and overall disability claims.  To comment on OP’s thoughts  there is much work being done on built environments to promote physical activity  healthier eating  and social interaction. There is also a lot of research into metabolic syndrome (the holy grail of chronic disease prevention). The CHANGE program is a great way to engage primary care and intervene with strategies to prevent chronic disease. For the ladies out there  this is especially important if planning to have kids. Further  metabolic conditioning is essential to preventing the downstream effects of long term chronic morbidity.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.15771043771043772,18926,

RVC is the most elite veterinary college in Europe  comparable to the most elite US schools like UC-Davis and Cornell. It was founded in the 1791 and I believe is the oldest vet school on Earth  at least among English speaking world.   This is not only a fantastic combination  but it couldn't easily exist elsewhere. Both RVC and LSHTM are constituents of the University of London system  which also houses other fantastic schools like the London School of Economics and King's College. That probably makes it much easier for them to offer a joint program.   I was going to say this is the equivalent of Cornell's vet school and Johns Hopkins' public health school joining forces  but those two they are separated by hundreds of miles and have no institutional relationship whatsoever. Honestly  I don't think there is any similar pairing anywhere in the entire United States (a fantastic vet school next door to a fantastic public health school). Perhaps UC Davis' vet school could pair up with UC Berkeley's public health school  but again  that's not nearly as convenient as being right next door  plus UC Davis has their own public health programs and probably wouldn't want to share a program with Berkeley. Perhaps UNC-Chapel Hill's SPH and NC State's vet school could work.

But going through your profile  I’m gonna guess your answer has something to do with the gut microbiome  because as the new cool thing  the microbiome holds the answer to everything  from curing cancer and obesity to unlocking interstellar flight.   The actual reason people are overweight is the abundance of highly palatable  calorie dense foods  coupled with an evolutionary design to consume more than we need  in order to store that food as fuel in case of a famine. It has next to nothing to do with the gut microbiome. Unless you’re saying that the microbiome influences hormones like leptin/ghrelin. But I’m pretty sure the current research hasn’t come far enough to prove that in any sort of conclusive way.   This is pretty simple biology. But unfortunately  there’s no business motive to change it on a level sufficient enough to make population wide changes. And there’s generally pushback when you try to forcefully alter peoples food choices through things like taxes. As I said previously  I’ve done some research into this  but people really do just like food.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.09103668261563,18961,

But it seems that with more food availability and less need for movement  a society will start leaning further into obesity.   If you’re arguing that CICO is flat out wrong  idk what to tell you  there’s[literally thousands of studies ](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C9&q=metabolic+ward&btnG=)  done in metabolic wards that disagree with you. Not that references are everything. I’m sure I could also find a bunch of studies that disagree with those metabolic ward studies. Or your cited studies. But taking the literature as a whole give the most complete picture. Anyway  mechanistically  it’s the most sensible model. If you tend to move more than you eat  you gotta get that energy from somewhere. Maybe that sentence needs more big complicated words to sound more appealing to you though?  As far as biology being simple  I meant simple as in fundamental.   As for your solutions  look to the historical examples of what’s happens when those solutions have been put forth.

I never thought about this because I was raised in a non standard American household- I think first time I had Mac and cheese from a box I was in my teens and my first peanut butter and jelly sandwich was in my twenties. I came to America when I was 6  and that kid of stuff was not ever viewed as food in my home. By all accounts the parents feeding their kids this stuff were average American parents... who were educated and financially average Americans.... yet they often gave their kids cookies for lunch and dinner from a box.   This probably goes back to the US of the late 1960s to 70s whne frozen food became popular and wasn’t it also somewhat of a status symbol?

Before I started  I applied directly to PhD programs at schools that did not require a master's degree  but I wasn't accepted. I had prior graduate level education  high gpa/gre  work experience  teaching experience  but not a lot of public health experience. Not saying it's impossible to be admitted without a master's  just that it's going to hard and you're probably going to want letters of recommendation from some heavy weight professors and/or be in contact with professors from the school first. When it comes to PhD programs  it's often as much about who you know (or who your advisor knows) as it is your personal attributes. Also  try to get on a couple of papers in your current labs  if possible. You don't have to be first author  but a publication record is important.   Next  if it's the hard sciences that you like  which is what it seems like from your two current lab roles  you will be pretty far removed from chem/biochem/biology in most public health fields. I was disappointed with the lack of biological training in my program. Most public health fields are more about qualitative and quantitative analysis of data than lab work. Just know what you're getting into and what kind of research you like.   Also  be realistic about the kind of public health research that gets funded. The reality is that a lot of the ""big"" studies are conducted by the CDC or other government organizations.  If I could do it all again (starting straight out of college)  I would do an MD/MPH program. MDs tend to get better funding from research organizations  and you can have more one-on-one interaction with research participants. Of course  it depends on your interests and if you have any interest in working with research participants in a medical setting.

This is as taking a year or two off school for relavent work experience (or work during undergrad) is equivalent in their eyes.   However  it definetaly vary between different fields  engineering is definetaly a different story. It seems everyone has a terminal degree of a masters degree. Same with public health it seems. But other departments are different it looks like.   Yes  u have a better chance with a masters  but it isnt required for many types of programs and even if it puts u at an advantage  that can be replaced with work experience and good letters from those respective mentors. but if we are referring to public health this isnt the case.  My parents happen to be very involved in academia and when one of them got their masters  it was a waste.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.1171875,19011,

Biochemistry is a good example of that.   &#x200B;  My parents happen to be very involved in academia and dw me to do a masters cuz one felt it was a waste of time for many reasons (ex: they could have gotton in anyways).,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.2388888888888889,19012,

If you have plans on becoming a professor  you’ll have to do a lot of research and work on getting some of your research published. My son  who has an MPH had a research study published in a reputable journal during his undergrad  and I believe that helped him get into all the public health schools for which he applied. He then had his capstone project published as well at the end of his MPH. So yes  definitely research  but you have to do more than just research something on your own.

You get to spend more time with patients and consider social determinants of health  something that’s probably important to you as a public health students. It’s much harder to get at the population level problems being a doctor.   P. S. Lots of PA schools don’t require orgo!,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.16203703703703706,19042,

I was very interested in public health but also interested in the clinical aspect. I applied to both MPH and nursing programs and ultimately ended up pursuing my MPH as it was a more flexible option and I’d be able to continue working.   However  wanting that clinical aspect never really went away and I realized this even more as I started looking for jobs in public health and the most interesting ones to me required clinical expertise. After thinking long and hard about it I decided to take the extra courses and apply for medical school and I’m applying this cycle. I also happened to get a job in my county public health department which I love so I’ve made peace knowing I’d be happy either way.   My advice would be to give yourself time to explore and decide what your ultimate goal is. There’s also the option of completing an MPH with your MD or getting a certification in public health as a nurse.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.1873015873015873,19043,

So I actually have a very similar story to yours (you’ll find that most MPHers do as well). Majored in microbiology  was premed  took the MCAT  but was not quite ready to take the plunge of applying for various reasons. I took a gap year and worked as a medical scribe and it was the best thing I could’ve done.   I highly highly recommend putting yourself in a work clinical setting to help you decide. What it did for me  is it exposed me to the reality of the policy issues that the health system faces and solidified my decision to go down the health policy track with my MPH.   I am now working for a congresswoman as a health policy fellow and I am never looking back to the medical field. But honestly  work experience is key  not only because it’s good to have on your application  but you will actually save a lot of money while you make your decisions. If you decide med school is your true calling  you won’t be in tens of thousands of dollars of debt before entering med school (because you pursued a masters).   As for OChem  if that really is the one thing standing between you and med school  grit your teeth and do it. I know it’s not fun but as an OChem veteran  you can do it. Also  there will be many obstacles on your path to becoming a physician (MCAT  applications  step exams  etc) but at the end of the day  it’s all about how bad you want it.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.15018518518518525,19044,

706,Beholder_of_Eyes,[Discussion] An interesting recent back and forth about the importance of focussing on weight loss vs cardiorespiratory fitness in tackling health problems associated with obesity.,"The initial article is [The Health Risks of Obesity Have Been Exaggerated](https://insights.ovid.com/medicine-science-sports-exercise/mespex/2019/01/000/health-risks-obesity-exaggerated/27/00005768)  which is followed up by a response [The Health Risks of Obesity Have Not Been Exaggerated](https://insights.ovid.com/pubmed?pmid=30550507).  In summary the initial article claims that there should be more focus (made *the* focus) on cardiorespiratory fitness (meeting the physical activity guidelines) compared to focussing on just weight loss  given that many mortality and cardiometabolic health factors associated with high BMI are reduced or eliminated when meeting physical activity guidelines. That is  one can be (cardiorespiratory) ""healthy"" and have a high BMI.

Could you elaborate on how this clarifies the problem?  >Any weight loss  regardless of cardio respiratory fitness  will lead to large cardiometabolic improvements.  It's interesting you say that given the first article has a section citing evidence directly against that claim. The section is even titled ""Removing body fat does not improve cardiometabolic health""  it is short enough so I shall quote it below   >Two meta-analyses demonstrated that surgical removal ofbody fat did not improve CVD risk profile (14 15). In one(14)  which included 357 patients from 15 studies  lipectomyof 2.06 to 16.3 L had no effect on any marker of CVD risk. Inthe other (15)  which included a systematic review (11 stud-ies) and meta-analysis (4 studies)  abdominal lipectomy wasnot associated with any improvement in triglycerides  high-density lipoprotein cholesterol  fasting glucose or bloodpressure. Data on insulin were mixed  with some studiesshowing an improvement in fasting insulin and insulin sen-sitivity in the systematic review  but no effect of lipectomy oninsulin sensitivity was observed in the meta-analysis. Even inobese women with type 2 diabetes  liposuction of 10.5 kg ofabdominal fat had no effect on insulin sensitivity or bloodmarkers of inflammation and other markers of CVD risk (16).The amount of fat removed in these studies is comparable to  orgreater than  the amount of weight loss typically associated withlifestyle interventions that improve markers of cardiometabolicheath. This calls into question whether body fatper seis the un-derlying cause of cardiometabolic abnormalities. The fact thatCVD risk markers can be significantly improved by changes indiet and exercise in the absence of fat loss also undermines theargument that body fat is the primary cause of the adversecardiometabolic risk profile associated with high BMI (17).  .  >If someone suffers from obesity and a chronic disorder from it (ie insulin resistance leading to CVD)  they are much better off losing 5% of their body weight than jumping on a treadmill.  Again the first article seems to be saying the opposite here. The claim is that the more relevant factor here is actually cardiorespiratory fitness and not body weight.

It suggests that either the meta-analysis showing that the obesity-mortality risk largely disappears in lieu of low CRF is wrong  or it suggests that the association between metabolic risk factors and mortality has not adjusted for CRF. You'd certainly agree that obesity failing to increase risk of mortality in lieu of low CRF is puzzling?  Ultimately  seeing no increase in the mortality outcome among fit people with high levels of body fat is more compelling evidence than seeing an increase in a risk-factor for mortality with increasing body fat - since that's clearly not relevant if it has no real world effect on primary outcomes (I'm simplifying  but you get the idea  I hope).

I just finished my Master's in epidemiology. I had half of my tuition covered on scholarship and worked in public health during school. The jobs I'm applying for pay a couple grand more than the jobs I had 5 years ago in an area with a much lower cost of living than where I got my degree. There are tons of positions available (I'm in a major east coast city)  but the pay is awful and the competition is often coming in with qualifications higher than required for the position.   Honestly  unless you want to do grunt work analysis data  writing IRB protocols  or making sure people follow the proper methods during a study  the master's degree is useless. You really need a PhD to do anything interesting  but the salary is still low  and the debt just gets higher. I had planned to do a PhD after my master's  but I realized that I find public health research very unfulfilling and often of terrible quality.  I also wanted to have more contact with research participants  but it's about impossible to do that in the US without a clinical degree of some sort. MPH/RN opens that up a little more  but I could see you doing just as well with an RN than with both degrees. Plus  if you need the MPH down there road  it's a very easy degree to get online.   I'm not comfortable saying I regret getting my degree  but I'm pretty sure I wouldn't do it again if I could go back knowing what I know now. If you do decide to do the degree  you absolutely have to work while doing it  and not at the University.

I think I’m more-so using the MPH as a stepping stone for something else clinical-based  like maybe an MSN or going MD perhaps. I already think I’m a little in over my head and the more and more I keep reading peoples stories on getting a MPH  the more and more I think I shouldn’t do it. Unfortunately  I’ve already signed a lease in my new city for grad school and it costs an absurd amount of money (that I do not have at all) to break it. So I guess I’ll just carry on and do the best I can to network and figure out what my path will be in the next 2 years.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.2332575757575757,19078,

Grad school is often sold as a path to something better  but I think that's only true if you have a very clear direction going in. The trouble is that you never really know what a field is like until you do the job.    It sounds like you have a lot of diverse academic interests (I have a similar problem). I think someone else said this earlier in the thread  but focus on gaining hard skills during your program. As an engineer  you may already have a leg up on some programming languages  but you can't really learn too many. If you're not afraid of math  you will also stand out among many people in a public health program.  If you're looking to go the clinical route after this  definitely spend time getting clinical hours while you're in school. A friend of mine who is planning to do medical school after her MPH was a scribe for most of her two year program. It gave her good letters of recommendation  a decent paycheck  flexible hours  and lots of real-world insight into being a doctor.   As for the lease  I was in the same situation when I moved for school. Honestly  being tied to a lease was one of the only reasons I stayed to finish the program. As cliche as it sounds  it's not always easy or comfortable  but it just kinda all works out. Even if you don't come out thrilled about your degree  you will at least have a better idea about what you want to do next. Good luck!,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.19586021505376347,19079,

This upsets me  because it takes away from the actual sources of health problems. Now I do not disagree that we need a universal healthcare system; I still (kind of) wouldn't disagree if you were to say it should be the number one health-related policy priority. I will support universal healthcare any chance I can. But the fact of the matter is  our healthcare system is one that cures  not one that prevents. If our system was upscaled to a universal system that prioritizes preventive care  then great. But health problems still remain  and they remain vast.  &#x200B;  Universal health care won't do that much more for your child that goes to Burger King everyday after school. Or if you work as a stressed-out truck or cab driver for 60 hours a week. Or if you're a kid hooked on Juul e-cig that inevitably switches to cigarettes for life not long from now. Or if you're so terrified and stressed at the risk of deportation at any given moment. Or if you live next to a polluting oil or natural gas facility in Texas. Or if your family goes fishing for food every other day in the polluted Gowanus Bay of Brooklyn. Or if you're an agricultural worker responsible for dispensing potentially carcinogenic pesticides in a state with poor workers' protections. Or if you're a part of the huge population of the world that will suffer from the inevitable massive public and individual health consequences of climate change. So many neighborhoods are traumatic environments (e.g. impoverished  urban neighborhoods) that are public health crises universal healthcare does not address. Even the school-to-prison pipeline is a massive public health issue. What about the public health issue of homelessness?  &#x200B;  Many people believe the solution to poor health is better health care  but it is much more than that. The issue is systemic  and unfortunately many don't understand or see this. Universal healthcare is a good starting point  but that's all it should be  a starting point. Broad systemic change and  in certain areas  upheaval  are necessary for truly addressing the issue of health.  &#x200B;  Edit: spelling  grammar  & syntax,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.10964894480519484,19080,0.227

A more lighthearted one is how so many people will argue that going out in the cold makes you sick. And when you explain that no  germs make you sick and being cold doesn’t really have to do with it  they say “then how do you explain that EVERY time I go out with wet hair I get sick??” Or sometimes they try to argue that going out in the mild cold for a short period of time is enough to drastically weaken your immune system.

Broadly  it's kind of crazy the amount of misinformation that exists out there  or people who find a narrow study or examination of an issue and latch on to it. I think my number one pet peeve is people claiming that X occupation  has the highest suicide rate. I have heard it all - doctors  nurses  lawyers  executives  service workers  veterinarians  dentists  accountants  law enforcement...  * A) the reality its that different occupations will both attract people with certain pre-dispositions to suicidality  and different jobs will pose different stressors on individuals that may put them at different risks in different ways. (High stress  long hours  emotional labor  physical labor  etc...) * B) Its not a race to the bottom  this isn't misery poker - everyone can be at risk and we should tailor interventions to a variety of groups. There is plenty of space to care about everyones mental health - we don't need to pin groups against each other or neglect some for others. * C) According to the best available data (not definitive  just the best we have at the moment)- excluding military  its construction workers  who rarely get mentioned. But even this fact is conflated because the occupation is largely male  which is its own risk factor - in fact many of the ""high risk"" occupations are male dominated  and males have higher rates  and the risk may not be attributed entirely to the occupation... basically its a complex issue.    Along these lines it can be frustrating when advocates let passion get in the way of good work that they can be doing  or ignore the work that is being done. I don't mean to paint people with a broad brush- as it takes a village to make injury prevention happen  and advocates have been essential in taking our statistics and motivating people. However  I have seen a few speakers/advocates who nothing will ever be good enough for  or spread misinformation on whats being done  or blatantly make up statistics that fit their narrative. But because they are emotionally tied to the issue (I've seen this with parents of kids who died by suicide turned advocates  as well as traffic safety advocates in particular)  it can be difficult to correct - or appropriately interject.",,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.10299886621315196,19086,

We have too many specialized doctors and not enough GPs or PCPs. Any of the stakeholders and legislators will see that we need to prioritize the production of GP/PCPs in order to actually deliver healthcare to EVERYONE. If the universal system focused on just up-scaling what already exists  there wouldn't be enough patients for the excessive amount of specialists. So  inherently  a significant portion of a true universal system would be preventive care.   &#x200B;  But there definitely would be opposition. After all  just by prioritizing primary care  we are inherently lowering the salaries of doctors and future doctors (this excludes reductions in salaries caused by other reasons  such as eliminating the practices of insurance companies where they practically steal money from doctors  thus doctors wouldn't need to charge as much  etc.). Med students would be specializing in general care at higher rates  effectively accepting lower salaries. Specialists would be in somewhat lower demand. Salaries would be lower  maybe even standard of living might be slightly lower  but they'll still have great standards of living. Regardless  this massive shift in industry would cause an uproar from many  including the AMA.   &#x200B;  What I'm scared of is the general public assuming the problem of health is solved just with the implementation of this universal system. It's far from solved  as I explained with the reasons above. Health is not just healthcare. It's environmental regulations  workers' protections  infrastructure planning  socioeconomic inequality/inequity and so much more.

I've worked in Tanzania  Kyrgyzstan  Afghanistan  Tajikistan  Haiti  and am currently in Liberia.  1. Single 2. My sort of gateway into this field was basically international internship with large NGO > consultancies with a small NGO > job with large NGO. I landed the first internship (I think) because I'd gotten an opportunity to do some research in Uganda around the health impact of community based water treatment systems. Short term consultancies with a small org were how I got just enough experience to break into the field  with varying levels of pay. 3. Yes  salaries are sufficient AND there's this quirk about the repayments. So  if you work for a registered 501c3  you qualify for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness with 120 qualifying on time payments. If you work internationally  you can qualify for the foreign earned income exemption - which means that up to like $102 000 - your gross income is $0 as far as the IRS is concerned. Which means you can make qualifying on-time payment minimums of $0 for PSLF. And your housing is often covered  so you can save a lot. Friend of mine bought a house in cash after 4 years. Might not be the best investment advice  but you can save a lot. 4. Dream location changes. I'd like to go back to central Asia. The wilderness there is unlike anywhere else I've ever been. 5. Get those quantitative  hard skills. Might be unpopular here  but it's far easier to pick up all the soft  sector knowledge on the job and to move from hard skills to soft skills than to go the other direction. 6. NGO. I think it's easy for idealism to sort of wither in the field - and years in the job often make people jaded. 7. Internships  self-directed learning.

764,zoevan,[Advice] Where should I apply for my MPH if interested in social determinants of health?,Hi everyone! I am an undergraduate who will be applying to MPH programs in the fall. I'm really interested in studying health inequities. As of right now  UNC Chapel Hill and Columbia are my top choices. UNC's Health Equity  Social Justice and Human Rights concentration and Health Behavior concentration and Columbia's Sociomedical Sciences department are both very aligned with my interests. I will also probably apply to the MSPH program at Johns Hopkins.

765,Teali0,[Advice] Potentially starting a Clinical Research Coordinator position,   Hello everyone  I'll try to keep this to the point.  I am roughly a month away from graduating with my MA in Clinical Psychology. In order to make my CV more competitive for PhD applications  I have decided to take time off from school and pursue a research position. I interviewed for a position and everything went well. A member of my cohort (I am graduating a year later than expected) currently works in the lab I applied for  and said the lead is not opposed to hiring me. I am going to be meeting the team in person (interview was via Zoom) in about a week  in which I hope an offer will be extended.  I have not heard back from any other labs I have applied for (10+)  but I heard back immediately (within an hour of application being submitted) for this lab. The reason I state that  is because I haven't had luck elsewhere  so I feel like I am really relying on this to line up.  But here is where things start to worry me. My friend who works in the lab said she takes home approximately $2000 a month. That is roughly $24 000 a year... for having a Master's degree... at a top 5 Children's Hospital. According to the job listing on the careers website  they state the pay range from \~$17-$28/hr ($32k-$53k). Additionally  Glassdoor provides a median salary of around $43k. For my first job with this degree  I definitely did not expect to make less than what I am currently making putting bread on a shelf at a grocery store.  The low pay isn't necessarily an issue for my friend because she has a household combined income to be able to afford a three bedroom home. Me  I am struggling to see how I can afford a barley held together apartment for $700 a month.  Is anyone able to provide some insight? Like  is a Master's level making 24k normal for these positions?

I think most doctors can strongly benefit from some background in public health  especially primary care or family doctors. I really applaud you for your interest in bringing this perspective to your future practice!  Seeing the big picture of the factors that influence your patients' lives and health outside of your office is key. I don't have much specific reading material to recommend  but to give you a sense of what public health is all about in a way that will be meaningful in medical practice  I suggest you get familiar with the concept of social determinants of health and with the socio-ecological model. They will help to expand your perspective of 1. what health and wellbeing is (i.e. more than merely the absence of illness) and 2. what factors influence health outcomes beyond medicine and access to medical care.  I'm providing a few links to short sources will give you a very brief overview of the topics and helpfully inspire you to seek on more. I'm also attaching some relevant articles to help put the two concepts I mentioned here into context and show some models for the role of the medical provider in public health. Hope this is a helpful start!

However  while understanding epidemiology and data analysis programs will be useful from a skills perspective  it does little to familiarize providers with a public health perspective and mindset. I don't think that addresses the need for an understanding of the broader impacts on health that are necessary for doctors to understand when interacting with their patients.

Two of the offers I was ""rejected"" from were offered to me  but the funding was never available  or pulled last minute. One of those was my dream job and after multiple rounds. I was pretty dejected for a while after that.  1. I wrote down what skillset I wanted to use in my daily work. Throughout my Ph.D I did mostly data analytics consulting  and wanted to switch to strategy development. In other words  move from the person in the field  to the person who decides what programs in the field get funded 2. I made a master list of potential employers  and ranked by interest. Your best shot at breaking into the USGOV/UN agency networks is straight out of school  so I ranked these highly. 3. For the top 5 institutions  I started looking at the company website job listings. Most of these never made it onto job aggregators. I also specifically checked the consulting portal  which is separate from the employment portal 4. I asked 4 of my advisors/colleagues if I could list them as references 5. I waited. I know the fiscal year ends in June for most large donors. You'll get a spate of last minute spending in May  and then a large number of listing in September/October as funding trickles down to NGOs and subs. Last October is when I started applying 6. I paid attention to my University job listserv. I was lucky to attend a namebrand school with a great network 7. I stayed in contact with past colleagues casually  so when I started looking  I could ask them to throw me any jobs they saw.

What’s the problem you’re trying to solve?  2. Would the time  money  and resources be better spent on a different intervention that could save more lives/reduce morbidity?  For number 1  I assume you’re targeting gun accidents  which total about 500 people killed annually. A USA Today article I just saw put child accident deaths at about 80 in 2018. Training does nothing to prevent intentional deaths such as suicide and poverty violence.   For number 2  you have to estimate some costs. There are 132 853 K-12 schools in the US. You cant teach a whole school training at once  so you’d likely need on average 20 training modules per school (guessing)? A training class needs to last likely between 4-8 hours. I estimate cost of instructor salary at $25 per hour. Multiply those out and the cost of education is $266-531M a year.   Half a billion a year possibly to train all students. What would the effectiveness rate be? Would it even prevent half of the deaths? Of the 80 killed in a year  and the value of of a statistical life at $9M  saving half would be $360M  possibly but not making up the costs of the program.

For the problem I am trying to solve  it is both accidental deaths but it is primarily changing ""gun culture"" and how people view guns. I think some people view guns as toys and don't ""respect"" them (sort of in the way a car is just a vehicle and you need to be safe with it  not recklessly drive fast). If we can get the culture around guns to change  I believe that would be effective in reducing other gun related deaths. I'm not sure if gun safety classes would achieve that  which is why I am asking here if anyone has seen studies on.  As for time and resources  that's a really good point. If gun safety classes wouldn't reduce the risk that much then I agree they wouldn't be worth it. But if research shows they can be effective in changing ""gun culture"" therefore possibly preventing other gun related deaths  then it would be worth it (but I haven't seen any data to prove or disprove that but I think it is worth looking into).",,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.2388888888888889,19166,

There is no singular gun culture in the US. Gun culture in the projects of Baltimore looks a lot different than gun culture in the Ozarks.  Saying you want people to stop treating them like toys tells me you’re still concerned about accidents  because neither the suicide victim nor the drive by shooting perpetrators see it as a toy  they are using it as a tool to intentionally inflict damage. Treating it as a toy leads to accidents  that’s about it. Nobody is committing mass shootings because they think a rifle is a toy.   This lack of concrete definitions is also why I despise the use of toxic masculinity below as an explanatory variable. What is that and how do you measure it? Nobody knows because it’s a pop culture phrase that has little to no place in epidemiology.

853,moonovrmissouri,[Advice] Help with writing a book on environmental health issues,I’m a recent MPH Grad working in environmental health for a state health department. I love it  despite the mundaness of working in regulation enforcement (I do a ton of inspections). I love making a difference and keeping folks safe.   One thing I’ve always been passionate about has been environmental health issues. I have a passion to bring these issues more mainstream but don’t know how to proceed. Any advice on how to write a book of this nature  outside of referencing studies  textbooks  etc. ? Is there a liability if I start naming corporations that are proven to be blamed for these incidents? How do you go about getting a publisher?   Any advice would be great  it’s just something I’d like to in my spare time. I have loads of free time now that grad school is over.,self,No video,2019-06-25 09:18:58,1.0,1.0,0.0,Statistics2015,I would think two things:  1.  Look for books that are similar to what you want to write  note who the publishers are  what the authors do  and maybe just reach out and ask about how they accept new work.  A lot of authors self-promote or end up writing shorter marketable pieces for online publications.  I think that's part of the business too  but I don't know how.  2.  Just start writing.  Write an introduction about why you are writing this book which could guide you on the rest of the process.  The more you have written and available  the easier it will be to figure out which publishers are a better fit.     These are just my guesses though.  Hope it works out  but if you're enjoying it  that's a win.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.40454545454545454,19212,0.123
854,CapitalCattywampus,[ADVICE] Time commitment for MPH (and other advice),I am interested in getting an MPH as part of a career transition. I have a PhD in chemistry  work as a contractor for the federal government doing program management in infectious disease  countermeasure development  etc for the DoD. I’m interested in moving further into health (esp epidemiology  for example supporting CDC or DoD. Example dream job would be GEIS)  building off current connections  leveraging my background in the government. I think an MPH would give me more credibility  supplementing my current credentials and giving me the technical skills I would need to get into the field.   I work full-time and can’t stop doing that at this point  so I’m looking at part time  online program. It’s really not feasible to do otherwise. I’m not so worried about developing a network through a grad program because I have a pretty deep network in the federal government and federal contracting worlds. In terms of cost/benefit  I’m inclined to the online Imperial College - London program. Good price  good reputation from what I’ve been able to find. No internship requirement  which also isn’t feasible given my job  but there is a research project  which I like. Sounds like fewer group projects than the US programs I’ve heard described - like most people with busy professional lives  the fewer group projects  the better.  1. I’m pretty sold on the thought that getting an MPH is a good idea for me but welcome counterpoints. Maybe I can leverage the network and experience I already have?  2. Online is pretty non-negotiable  and I’m not going to drop 80k on Hopkins. Other than that  I welcome input. Is a UK program a terrible idea  for example?  And the thing I’m most concerned about/am really looking for the most input on... 3. Is working a high-demand job while trying to do a two-year program going to be a nightmare? In terms of hours per week  how much time do people typically spend? Hopefully my coding experience gives me a bit of a leg-up  but if this is a halftime job on top of my current job  it’s going to be tough...  should I look for a three year program instead? I recognize that this may be a thing for which there’s never an ideal time  so maybe it’s just a matter of biting the bullet for a couple of years. What do you all think?  Thanks for input!

It will not add anything of particular value to you. If you are working in program management on infectious diseases...you are already *doing* public health.   I have colleagues who have worked full time in demanding jobs while getting a Masters or PhD  it can certainly be a **major** challenge. One of my colleagues did his PhD in 7+ years  it wasn't as bad for him  but it was certainly a slog. Another of my colleagues is on track to be done in 3 years...her life is quite miserable.   Like I said  I don't think it will add anything of particular use to you.   I would encourage you to pick up skills piece meal though. Stuff like knowing how to do data analysis using R and/or SAS  knowing how to use GIS  working with big data sets & small geographies are all very useful skills to have. I would incorporate using those skills into your every day job if at all possible so you can show it off on your resume.   You could probably get into CDC right now in a 0685 (Public Health Advisor) slot  and wiggle your way into a more epi focused position. Those jobs are quite difficult to get though. Most programs are super happy to have someone who has a more technical bent working on program management  as it is really helpful to have someone dealing with contracts & overall program strategic direction who knows some of the technical aspects of the program.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.10476666666666667,19213,0.284

As I’m sure you know  many people get their masters in the process of getting their PhD  so IMO your PhD supersedes an MPH. As someone with a global health masters from a top UK university  it’s also worth pointing out that the curriculum will likely be a fair bit different. For example  in a U.S. MPH program you’ll spend a fair bit of time learning about medicare/medicaid  while this is obvious non-existent in U.K programs. It sounds like that wouldn’t be much of an issues since you’re focusing on CDC and not CMS positions though. Why not apply before going for the MPH and if you run or don’t hear back from places or get rejected you can reconsider?,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.26153846153846155,19214,

If you have data skills  insurance companies are a place to start.  I would contact contractors or recruiters if you haven’t already. Easiest way to get a job in the government is to start as a contractor  and if they really like your work & you can fit a niche  the program you work with will try to bring you on as a full time employee (FTE).

Wheeler’s most significant step came on Wednesday  when he signed a final rule to repeal and replace the Clean Power Plan (CPP)  President Obama’s signature regulation to fight climate change... The new Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule requires the power sector to cut its emissions by 35 percent over 2005 levels by 2030. It’s a measly target  one that 'the industry is already on track to achieve  even without federal regulation ' *The Washington Post* [noted](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/trump-epa-finalizes-rollback-of-key-obama-climate-rule-that-targeted-coal-plants/2019/06/19/b8ff1702-8eeb-11e9-8f69-a2795fca3343_story.html?utm_term=.b21743636782)—and one that is 'less than half of what experts calculate is needed to avert catastrophic warming of the planet...'  The ACE rule is expected to have dire  even fatal consequences for Americans’ health.

Like at my school  the MPH still allowed you to ‘major’ in epi  but Epi MPHs had to take more classes outside of the concentration (behavioral science and education  health policy and management  global health  etc) while MSPH epi students were required to take the more advanced epi methods courses  but we all really came out qualified for the same jobs. It varies school to school though—in some schools the MPH is just a general degree and you don’t have the option to be an Epi MPH.   Job-wise  I’d say go with whatever appeals more to you and the opportunities will be there. If you are a clinician that wants to be involved in running outreach programs  health advocacy  social justice  and the like  the MPH will give you a solid foundation in epidemiology and all of those things. If you are a clinician that wants to work for a teaching/research hospital and design/conduct/publish epidemiological studies  the MS might be better.

'Someone reported 15 kids from this one school got diarrhea' or 'why does our county have 15 times the national rate of colon cancer'.

What an interesting read.  I do want to push back a little on the author's claim that it's unethical for hospitalists to deny admission to patients they haven't examined. I'd argue the opposite  in fact: hospitalists should examine patients before admitting them  especially in cases where there is debate regarding whether they should be admitted at all. If a doctor admits a patient  they are taking responsiblity for providing care for that patient.  Why would they accept that responsibility for a patient they never examined and whose report they don't think need hospitalization?  Emergency departments serve as a major funnel for admitting patients to the hospital. Dr. Baldwin even references this in her testimony - when she has patients that she thinks need hospitalization that are denied a direct admission  she sends them to the Fairview ED. This is a common and widely accepted practice. My thought then is that the hospitalist who never examined the patient should have assumed that the practitioners would  send their patient to the ED if they believed she needed inpatient care  and he had no reason to believe otherwise.   The failure of care is then on the NP and her overseeing MD for not sending the patient to the ED. The MD not examining the patient but overriding the NP's diagnosis is definitely questionable  especially given that the overseeing MD ultimately takes responsibility for the NP.   That all being said  wtf is this about diabetes. Ignoring that it's a weird diagnosis to start with  uncontrolled diabetes can also be deadly. So even assuming it was diabetes  significantly abnormal lab work would still probably warrant inpatient treatment (or at least some fluids and meds and a second check of the labs before discharge).,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",-0.08333333333333334,19370,0.0
