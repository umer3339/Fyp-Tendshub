The economy of Venezuela won't get better even if 50 billions of U.S dollars are thrown in there. You need to fix the economic system first  else people will keep starving to death.  Sanctions placed against Maduro's officials who are violating human rights systematically don't even affect the average venezuelan but only those specifically targeted.

Considering his allies are more than happy in giving him loans for billions of dollars. The debt is not even recognized by the venezuelan parliament  a requeriment for debt issuance  borrowing  or making deals with other countries.  The problem Maduro has is not the sanctions  but his rejection to democracy and the laws of Venezuela that don't allow him to do whatever he want to do  while other countries are abiding to these laws and respecting them being cautious  Only of Maduro would recognize the venezuelan parliament and allow it to do their work to audit Venezuelan Central Bank accounts  and so on  everything will certainly go better  even if sanctions are placed.  Reduction on imports is not an effect of sanctions.

Just blew my mind that they had all of his paintings there  neatly labeled with no plans on doing anything with them.  Bob Ross is beloved.  They should start selling/auctioning these.  They can put the money in a foundation to use for whatever charitable causes they believe best suits Bob's name  he would want.  There will never be a better time as those of us who grew up watching Bob Ross are the ones with the income to now purchase his work.  If they wait too long the paintings will be near worthless due to the sheer volume of his work and those in the future not having the attachment to Bob Ross we generation Xers do.    They shouldn't flood the market or anything but they should definitely start selectively releasing his work for auction.  A few examples of each different landscape style.

I followed a link the dude had to some online page  which lead me to his personal FB page eventually.  I was a little miffed  because I got outbid on a 0/0 account (noob with no buy or sales)  and I was assuming it was a friend of his trying to jack up the price.  I had a bid of only 1 buck  so I didn't expect to win.  Especially since the reserve hadn't been met.  Well all of a sudden  that one other bid met the reserve price.  So odd and convenient.    Well  I easily found his friend list and I fully suspect I'm right.  Not going to complain or anything; just avoid the seller in the future.

First off  there was no real way to look people up on Facebook in 2006. The search feature didn't really exist then  you typed in a name and either there was an exact match or not  that was it.   Second there were no Facebook applications until much later  2010/12ish if I recall correctly. I can't remember when the API for like buttons etc was released  but that was well after 2006 as well.   You also were unable to provide links or embed tracking pictures in Facebook profiles like you could with Myspace  so no third party methods of tracking.   Basically there is no way she could have done this at that time.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.0125,42089,

Same can be said for noscript  or any of the privacy tools that mess with 3rd party cookies and the like.  As long as it's an optional feature that the browser lets you turn off or on  I can't see why it would be a problem.  As for the value of stripping the metadata from the upload  /u/lurking_grue said that he downloaded the same pic from two different endpoint IPs and the GUID didn't change  so perhaps you're right.    On the other hand  he also said he didn't have a Facebook account  so he won't have been able to test whether the GUID changes when you download a picture using different FB identities.  Either way  just because they're not doing it now doesn't mean they won't do it later: doing so would mean that when a picture is uploaded again  they get to know the identity of someone who downloads (and saves) pictures from their site  and they have a potential correlation between the identity of the downloader and the uploader.  Edit: for that matter  I'd expect FB to eventually code in sourceIP  useragent  FB identity (if known)  and the date that the file was accessed.  All of that information is useful for when these files eventually get uploaded again.

A friend of mine did his PhD through UofM at the level 4 lab doing virology  it would be rather difficult to smuggle any 'samples' out of that facility. Level 4 pathogens are an extreme risk to the individual and a high risk to the community (ie. you will die and there isn't much doctors can do about it and you're infectious while you do it); I don't think there are many individuals out there brave enough to try to move that stuff without proper containment. In the comments below you mention the spanish flu and the black death  There is no 'Spanish flu' at the lab because no stock of that were made during the outbreak. There was a paper in Science reconstituting the strain but the authors were american. That flu strain had a surprisingly high mortality rate for 'healthy' individuals (ie not old or young)  and that was only in the 1.6% area (super high for flu). The outbreak was a perfect storm scenario where large populations at the end of WWI were shuffling back around the world and the bombed out europe wasn't particularly in a healthy state. With the recent examples of SARs and swine flu  even in todays 'interconnected' world  stuff like that gets stamped out pretty quick  for black death that is a non issue - its an infection by Yersinia pestis which is quite curable with antibiotics. The black death was a result of the squalor conditions of medieval times/famine and a failure to deduce how the disease spreads. First world sanitation practices are very effective at preventing bacterial infections unless you have underlying medical issues (ie. immonocompromised). Fun fact about the black death  people that though it was gods punishment started killing cats as they were connected to satan; because the plague was vectored by fleas carried by rats that plan kinda back fired   creating a ficiton level bioweapon is not really feasible. can it be done? Probably. Anyone doing it? I doubt it. It would take an insane amount of expertise  high grade facilities  and staff with loose ethics. The japanese Unit 731 was pretty much dedicated to it in WWII (and they did some really fucked up shit) and the effectiveness could be classified as 'meh'. High on the terrorism  low on strategic gain. Bio weapons are hard to control  maintain  and deliver; its why chemical weapons became preferred.   I am interested to see what secrets these people were likely shuttling to their motherland. As they aren't arrested or charged currently it seems like they are breaking some serious university policies (transferring data of some kind i would imagine).,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.063649018,22816,

South Park S02E02 - Cartman's Mom Is Still a Dirty Slut  Just as Mephesto is about to announce who Eric Cartman's father is  the electricity goes out  the room is darkened  and two gunshots are fired. As the lights come back on  everyone discovers that Mephesto has been shot. Chef notes that he is still alive and  along with the boys  rushes him to the hospital. Upon entering the hospital  they meet Dr. Doctor  and a nurse with no arms named Nurse Goodley; they are the only ones working in the hospital. He manages to get Mephesto on a life support system  but has many other patients to tend to. Outside  a terrible blizzard brews.  While the rest of the adults in town and a visiting television crew film a reenactment for America's Most Wanted  a tree falls on the power line causing the power to go out. All of the adults are now stuck in a building until the storm settles. The group hastily resort to cannibalism to survive. The power also goes out back at the hospital  and a plan is enacted to restore it. Dr. Doctor suggests that they split into two teams: team A  consisting of everyone in the room except Kenny  and team B  consisting of Kenny. His job is to reconnect the generator in the cold  while team A give advice to him via walkie-talkie as they enjoy some hot cocoa and TV.  Once Kenny gets to the generator  he discovers that there is no wire connecting the cords  so he decides to make the connection himself to restore the electricity  fatally electrocuting himself in the process. Thanks to his brave deed  the power is restored and Mephesto survives. After casually revealing his shooter was his brother  he gathers everyone in the emergency room for the revelation of Cartman's father: his mother Liane. Mephesto explains that Liane is a hermaphrodite  someone with both male and female genitalia. He also reveals that hermaphrodites cannot have children  so Liane must have impregnated another woman on her intercourse spree. An angered Cartman then demands who is mother is  but when a narrator questions who his mother might be  he quickly refuses to pursue the issue further.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",-0.023412698,27698,

Which is always going to be an issue with public-private partnerships  but that's a direct result of the city's desire to continue utilizing private companies to do city works. I don't know if it was shoddy maintenance at this point  because not enough information has fully come out yet about the cause  so I don't want to jump to conclusions when it's too early to say.   And no  they can't succeed at only one important thing. For an extreme example  if the government was incredibly successful at running the MTA  but not wholly successful at running electricity  we'd be just as pissed  if not more so. Governments were designed to do multiple things at once  because that's the whole point of government. They can still organize electrical works and solve public health issues at the same time.

If you think about the rule of three  thirty days without food  three days without water  three minutes without air.  The important one is water.  You run out of water in a big city because the water treatment plant is down  then you only have so much bottled water at stores which would be gone by the time people try to leave.  They get desperate and drink out of contaminated rivers.  30% don’t make it out  they die of dysentery or dehydration.  Look at Katrina  only no one comes to help.  It makes sense.

You are linking articles pointing out that America's Power Grid is a target  I never said it wasn't I said it wasn't super vulnerable. Something being a target and something being vulnerable are not the same thing. The US federal agencies are target as is the banking system  that doesn't mean they are vulnerable. I literally work with Power companies and helping them implement NERC CIP regulations. I think I have a better grasp on the topic than someone who links posting articles thinking they know what they are talking about. The biggest threat to the Power Utilities companies and every company is people. You can set regulations and policies  but if people don't follow them that doesn't matter. Which one of your articles by the Wall Street Journal references where Russians were targeting vendors and contractors and got credentials and gain some sort of access before being detected. The level off access they gained and to what extent and to what systems was not given in the article  that said NERC has taken this attack into new regulations around third party access  the ability to shut it off if immediately if you detect they are compromised and as well as greater requirements on baselines. If you are interested on the standards check out [CIP 005-6 and CIP 010-3.](https://www.nerc.com/pa/Stand/Pages/CIPStandards.aspx) Saying that is grossly insecure and vulnerable is just fear mongering  it isn't. Is it perfect and 100% secure from a cyber perspective  no  but nothing is unless if it is disconnected from the internet and turned off. And again I am only talking from a Cyber perspective if someone went around blowing up transmission stations and or power plants that is a completely different conversation and totally possible  though obviously isn't easy or cheap. But yes I agree with all your articles that the grid is a target  that doesn't mean it is vulnerable.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.014910468,27856,

Fill your desk space with some cute little theme for you  and throw up some cute borders on the whiteboards and whatnot. But aside from that  try to let the things that go up on the walls be class-made.   Create an anchor chart that with their input that covers your rules and expectations on that first day of school--this will help them build up critical thinking and will help them later on when you're teaching them to be accountable.   Create an anchor chart with the class for each theme/topic that you teach and display them as you go  pulling some down as they become no longer necessary.   Have them help to create some charts for things like basic writing rules  math rules  etc. that you can post in a writing center or help area.   As little-kid as it sounds  have them create some art work or show off their classwork. 4th graders still love to have their hard work shown off. It helps them build pride and self-worth/self-respect and shows them that you are also proud of the work that they do. Dedicate a space to great work and have a space for every child  making sure every child always has a piece of work up and switching out for new work often--you can even allow the kids to switch out work on their own when they want to show something new off. Dedicate another space specifically to art and take some time once every couple of weeks to do a relevant craft with your kids. Science and social studies lend themselves well to crafts.

Do you have any other 4th grade teachers at your school that you will be working with?  I would start out by looking at/measuring classroom furniture and drawing up a map of the room.  Start thinking about books that you want to read outloud to your class (I read every day to my students.)  A good way to start the year is to read one book from a few different series at different levels to introduce kids to a variety of books.  Also  some kids that are lower readers will be more likely to read books at their level if you have read one to the class.  Henry and Mudge  Magic Treehouse  Cam Jansen  Diary of a Wimpy Kid are some good choices to start with.    Then for yourself I would suggest making a curriculum map for the year.  A grid with the subjects down the side and the months across the top  then figure out what you need to cover in each month to give yourself a picture of what the year looks like to help with planning.  This is something your team mates may already have.

Always drives me a little crazy to see 3rd-5th grade rooms totally devoid of child input and all about whatever sassy theme the teacher threw up on every visible surface.   In Kinder anchor charts are so fun. It only gets better as they go up in age and ability and are able to offer more and more input! They have such important things to say and class-created works like that are a super effective way to exercise some student-centered teaching. We also work a lot with vertical alignment of learning standards here (skills building on each other over each grade level  like K counting to 100  3rd learning multiplication  and 5th learning division) and I always found it fun to take a Kindergarten lesson and anchor chart and up the difficulty + update the theme to make it relevant and challenging for older kids.

At one point i did headbutt my wife because in the dream i was fighting for my life  at times i just jump and it has concerned me. It feels weird  the one i remember the most vivid i was sleeping and my wife was next to me. In the dream there was an intruder walking in the room  i was a child and my brother was sleeping next to me too as a kid. I hid under the covers and told myself in the dream  this person is here to kill me! so i hid and thought i'll attack him and throw the blanket on him before he gets me. So i jumped in the dream and jumped in my bed. My wife woke up like WHAT? WHAT HAPPENED ? I'm not sure if i'm having a bad case of lucid dreaming but i think this only happens if my body flips to face the ceiling while i sleep  then my physical body wakes up and reacts to whatever i dream.

There can be consequences to public opinion. That's a reality of us being social creatures. It's also a fact that it's an imperfect world and consequences aren't fairly distributed to those who deserve them. Whether it is social justice or criminal  the system is imperfect. It's imperfect if we exercise our own judgment and it's imperfect if we defer judgment to others.  But I'm going to go with my own judgment  imperfect as it is  and I don't blame anyone else for trusting their own judgment as long as they aren't trying to take justice into their own hands.  One of the benefits of the court of social opinion is that we must not only make sure not to cross a legal line into criminality  but it is important that we not skirt the line so close that we even give the appearance of guilt. Perfection isn't possible  but the combination of avoiding situations that could be perceived as criminal  combined with the general unlikeliness of a false accusation allows most of us to avoid being judged guilty socially while being innocent.

No. A fraction of a percent of injury related deaths.

The long story  Hong Kong (HK) was for 99 years a colony of the British Empire  this expired in 1999. Current law is that the government can't extradite people from HK to more conservative areas (here conservative means strict communist). So the government appointed governor of HK pushed through a law that people could be extradited to old China for minor offenses  where they'd be thrown into reeducation camps (China has >10% of some populations in reeducation camps).  The government is treading on thin ice  this is exactly how the royals in France were invited to the scaffold (visit the guillotine).,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.04375,20330,

The fact that China still isn't killing the bill  and are now currently evaluating the situation is opposite of successful. China is playing the long game  they delayed the bill but it will pass eventually.  The only thing that the party cares about is staying in power  and that means having the implicit support of the mainland population  who really doesn't give a damn about Hong Kong. The protestors changed tactics recently and tried to appeal to mainland visitors  but their lack of success isn't really surprising considering the difficult relationship between the two.  While we on Reddit can give ourselves a clap on the back and think we are making a difference by upvoting a story and getting it known to as many people as we can  that doesn't mean much in today's politics. In fact  international recognition and condemnation means squat when it comes to recent international relations. See Trump  see Saudi Arabia  see Brexit.

It's more just a lack of investment leading to a shrunken gap in capabilities.  China's military  while not even close to parity with the US  has reached the point where a campaign inside their sphere of influence will be costly in some sense of the word  which worries me in light of what I percieve to be a lack of political will.    China's achievements in military technology may be overblown(there are too many ridiculous headlines about Chinese wunderwaffen).  But the technological balance is now such that they can deny area to US fleets *unless leadership is willing to unambiguously commit to war against China*  with preemptive/suppressive strikes against -for instance- their ASM capability.  The public is also unused to high-intensity near-peer warfare.  If things go poorly  worthwhile or not  more US servicemen could die in a week(or a day) than have died in any given year of the 21st century.

Finally  the USA is no longer allied with China in the same way as we were up until the early 2000s.

So the major island groups of the South China seas  the Paracels and Spratleys  were used by the fishermen of what would become various states  before the modern era. These included Chinese  Vietnamese  Indonesian and Malay  as well as others. In the 1940s the Chinese started claiming these islands (which were almost all too small to support permanent habitation)  as traditional Chinese territory.   Basically  they belonged to no-one specifically until the modern era  but are now disputed between China and 8 other states  as since WW2  the rights of states to the Exclusive Economic Zones surrounding these islands would bring lucrative fishing rights and the right to explore for oil and gas. China are certainly wrong to claim all the islands to the exclusion of all other parties  but there are certain islands not falling naturally into anyone's coastal EEZ or in disputed EEZs that China's claim to is about as good as anybody else's.  Since the 1980s nations claiming South China Seas islands have started building up the islands into maritime bases so that they count as 'islands' (able to sustain a human population) rather than 'rocks' (unable to sustain a human population) by UN definitions. In 2016 the UN ruled that these artificial islands did not count for asserting sovereignty  which the Chinese ignored.

Whatever semantic thing you want to get caught on is besides the point... they are a form of dangerous government which we don’t want spreading.   Second  shoring up the Middle East is a tactical long term decision. It’s the one thing that prevents a worst case total war scenario. Global energy reserves couldn’t sustain a long serious conflict without access to the Middle East oil reserves. Russia and China would run out of reserves within a few months in a total war scenario. So the USA just has to turtle up in the Middle East and win out via attrition.   And yes I do think the USA has the moral authority to be world police. Having a hegemony is essential for global stability  and the reality is only three countries have the scale and infrastructure to fill that role today  leaving the USA as the lesser evil by a long shot.

We dole out foreign aid like candy. A lot of European countries don't have a defense budget to ward off invaders  they rely on the US coming quickly. Japan  Israel  South Korea  Canada all prosper in part of the fact that US is warfare arm of the free world. The US literally stood out the Bosnian war initially and Canada and the European NATO countries invaded for peacekeeping and failed. They claimed that they could not do it without us aid. The literal moment the US stepped in the war was over. Even then people were saying that the US took too long. Going back to ww2 the US has to step up to protect the rest of wartorn Europe from Stalins encroachment after he reneged on the yalta agreement. Since we were the only one of our allies with the ability to go against them we fought all of the wars. We did not start the wars in the middle east. We inherited it from France  England  and the last czar of Russia after they were unable to keep the people they wanted in power via the closed-door deal that was the Sykes-Picot agreement where in France and the UK attempted to split up the middle east for their own colonies and Nickolas was okay with it.

International relations is a messy game where necessity often dictates that vice must often be embraced to defend virtue. But as of now America managed to fend off a potential world order of authoritarianism alliances by winning the Cold War  and since then global metrics for progress improve year over year. The American hegemony has brought military conflict to practically negligible levels  and prosperity and quality of life is off the charts thanks to the stability America has brought. Even when we “go into countries for resources” we do so in a way that rings in infrastructure and economic development.

That’s a huge problem. While what’s going on at the border is a tragedy  claiming that migrants being there *strictly* as an American foreign policy problem is just wrong. And even in a world where this would be the case  it doesn’t mean that America owes anybody in those countries anything nor has to let migrants become US citizens. Unless you want to argue that is true of any country engaging in geopolitics  which you won’t.  Second  borders exist for a reason and they are not typically able to handle an influx or migrants like we saw recently. I’m not saying conditions are great or there aren’t bad people  but it seems very strange to me to engage in attaching the concentration camp label to this situation when the migrants could have never came to the border or could return home freely. Also what is this systematic child abuse you’re talking about? Is it related to the situation at the border or something else?

My grocery store has about 50 high sugar low fat options and like 3 that are high fat and low in sugar. Its ridiculous.  Most reasonable I've seen in grocery stores that still tastes OK is Icelandic Skyr. But homemade yogurt is deceptively simple!  Scald some milk  let it cool  mix in yogurt culture  cover  keep temp steady for 8-24 hours (longer = more tart result)  then turn out the yogurt and strain off excess whey till it matches your preferred consistency. The only fiddly part is keeping the temperature stable  but I culture in an InstantPot which makes that step set-it-and-forget easy. You can use the whey for pancakes or biscuits. Because the yogurt bacteria metabolize sugars in the milk  the final product has less natural sugar than the milk that it was made with (longer culture = less lactose  etc. remaining at end).,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.126491228,36645,

Reading your comment made me wonder. Here (somewhere in eastern Canada)  the food that makes up the donations is 50% chick peas and red beans. Now  I don't want to spit on free food  but everybody hates getting those in a food basket  yet there seems to be an infinite amount in pantries elsewhere.  There's gotta be a reason why this happens. Two foods which presumably people like A LOT  since they buy it in absurd quantities  collectively. Yet when it comes time to give stuff out  they give that up first almost as if it was garbage. And there's always lots left over because people don't eat them?  So basically  you have two groups of people. One buys huge amounts of food they won't eat and don't like that much. The other group  which probably NEEDS the same food  only takes it begrudgingly when offered  and wonders why the first group needed so much of this boring food...There's a system here  with chick peas and red beans going around  changing hands. But I don't get it at all. It needs people to LOVE buying these things  but not eat them.  Only way it all makes sense is if we've been seeing the same cans being injected into the system for the past 50 years. Anyway.

We are talking about anti-vaxx flat earth society - people who are so poorly eduacted that you can literally control their thoughts with a neatly engineered article with a clolourful picture with smiley model in medical smock. It takes decades to reeducate society on one topic and our society is adjusting too slow so I believe drastic measures should be taken.  Ie. obesity is HUGE problem all around the 1st world countries - and we get ""no fat shaming you misoginist swone!"" while everyone should call it FAT CANCER because it FCKIN KILLS YOU KAREN!  Children are unprotected and they can't defend themselves  they are cultivated customers  fed with social-engineered commercials designed to make their brains pump dopamine into their blood. Then they WANT the candies  which are SWEET and they like them. For children it's good because it's tasty. And it's probably addictive  I didn't find a scientific document confirming sugar actually is addictive tho  so I can't say for sure. But I was searching for 5 minutes.  So yeah  we need to educate parents  but they are often as stupid as their children. In the meantime  maybe we could do something about aggresive social-engineered campaigns targeting young uprotected brains in the same way mobile games do with micro transactions - by abusing human brain reward emchanism and literally rewiring young brains into believing that their goal is to eat that candy/boost up that number/get that toy...   When I babysit my nephew it's so obvious - in a playgarden(is that a correct word?) there's 20 kinds of sweets for children and 0!!!! fruits/healthy snacks. Kids don't like them. Because they are taught from earliest age that the sweet is the good thing. And they can get really creative to get them  kinda like heroin junkies :) My nephew tried multiple different approaches to get me to buy him candy - and as much as I hate it  I usually do  but I'd rather get him an apple  which I can't buy at the place...  Current society problems are multi-layered and saying ""just educate parents"" is ignorant. First of all most people don't want to be educated - THEY ARE GROWN UPS AND YOU WILL NOT BE TELLING THEM THEY ARE STUPID AND DON'T KNOW STUFF.

It's what I do. It's really not time consuming if you learn to do it the lazy way  which is what I do. Because I'm lazy.  Any kind of raw meat is super easy to make. You just dump some seasoning on it  and there are all sorts of seasonings you can mix and match endlessly  and throw it in the oven for 30 or 40 minutes. The time consuming part is cleaning up dishes if you don't have a dish washer because meat is oily. And if I'm complaining about cleaning dishes being the slow part you know it took 0 effort.  Cooking yourself: you just have to learn what tastes good. A lot of asian diets have great tasting recipes that are easy to make because they're often just rice  noodles  vegetables  and the meat you just baked in the oven. Noodles boil in 4-6 minutes. Rice takes more time but it's still just boiling. Vegetables can be boiled or stir fried depending on preference. Again all really quick. I tend to use a combination of fresh and frozen vegetables. Onions are huge. Peppers are great. Both  are great because they're not bland vegetables so they themselves add to the taste.   But it all comes down to the seasoning. You gotta get familiar with all the seasoning out there like onions  peppers  garlic   chilli powder  curry powder  soy sauce  hot sauce  whatever floats your boat  which requires trial and error  but it's worth it.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.265213675,36696,

Glucose ( a sugar monomer  one part of sucrose and both parts of maltose  common sugars as we know them) is the main energy unit of our body. Our body gets almost all of its energy from oxidizing glucose. (glycolysis is in fact  the foundation of energy production for non-plant  non chemosynthetic life)   Insulin is released in response to elevated blood glucose and signals to the muscle and the liver to start producing glucose intake channels so they can start to be used as energy. This is the primary function of insulin and insulin receptor. It would not make too much sense if sugar broke these receptors at a normal concentration  because it is literally what they are built to do  and glucose is necessary for life.    now  type two diabetes (the 2 much sugar type) comes from developing a resistance to insulin. This IS in part caused by consumption of **TOO MUCH SUGAR  TOO OFTEN**. In response to elevated glucose levels all the time  your body just stops responding to a ""normal amount"" of insulin (same concept as drug tolerance) or your pancreatic cells just fuck off and stop working. Again  this is due to TOO MUCH. Not just any amount.  Sugar does NOT damage your insulin receptors. It induces release of insulin so that that glucose can be uptaken.   Now in nature there are many ways that we can consume our sugars (and you need to  no carbs no life) and some are healthier than others. Ideally  you would want to consume your sugar in the form of complex carbs  which are basically just long chains of sugars linked together  with many branches. This would constitute the healthiest method of consumption. On the other end of the spectrum are Processed sugars. These are still the same sugars that are present in complex carbs (and to reiterate  the same sugars that you need) but they are present in much simpler forms. This simpler form makes it much easier to break down  and causes concentration spikes  which  when consumed in great amount  and very often  can lead to insulin resistance.   obviously this is all without considering the other factors that go into diabetes  like heredity and sheer luck.  Now then  once you have diabetes  meaning you body cant respond to sugar so it builds up in the blood - thats when you can start calling sugar bad. Glucose will build up in your blood vessels  and thats when you start getting effects like neuropathy.  That is all to say  no  you are wrong. Sugar doesnt harm you  great amounts of it do. As with anything. The meme that ""fat isnt bad  Sugar is!"" is fairly accurate to a degree  considering the absolute disgustingly high concentration of processed sugars in our modern food  but it is a far cry from being biologically viable. You still need sugar. And one candy bar  with all of its processed sugars and gross chemicals  will not harm you as much as a cigarette.   So please  if you are going to make such hardline statements  educate yourself on the actual mechanisms of the subject in question. And if you won't  don't spread false information. It gets really hard to counter in the future.     Also  while you are correct  tobacco is soaked in sugar  its a comparatively minuscule amount.   oh and for anyone who comes by to nitpick my breakdown  i know i left out and simplified stuff. dont bother",,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.038199588,36748,

Especially when introduced to the body as separated from the fiber of the actual fruit  most of the fructose will not be used by the body for immediate energy  instead it gets processed by the liver into a number of compounds that are quite bad for you in other ways.   The worst effects are to the cardio- vascular system. Everytime you process the fructose  you are hit with a triple whammy of VLDL  nitric binding compounds and inflammatory compounds.

I'm not a hardcore lefty myself  probably more centrist but like most left leaning millennials I have plenty of very strongly left leaning friends and it's just not something I hear.  Meanwhile the hard right can openly protest against Muslims in the street  they can murder an MP days before the referendum and it's all cushty. As a British person it's all so confusing. I'm totally against anti-Semitism but I've heard far more in the media about the anti-Semitism of the British left than I've actually heard coming from the British left.

He could - and almost certainly will - go under oath and simply answer questions that are clearly answered within his report.  The point is that most Americans who will watch this on TV - and even politicians from both the Dems and Reps - will not have read the report  either in whole or in part.  Muller could just sit there and read sections of the report aloud  and this will be the first time a large part of the audience will hear it.  He doesn't need to do any more investigative work; just read out what he and his team have already uncovered.  It might not change anything - but if it means people (general public or members of the House / Senate) who haven't read the report get a better understanding of its content from an impartial source (i.e. not from Trump  Barr  Huckabee-Sanders  Conway  Fox News  Breitbart  etc)  then it can only serve to educate and spread the truth - that the report *was not* an exoneration  and that there *were* efforts made to obstruct justice.  And hopefully this will help to motivate voters to turn out to the polls next year to try to prevent him getting a second term.  And yes  you're right - Trump doesn't need a reason to be a racist ass.  It's what comes naturally to him.

That is actually false. It's all based on a quote from the book ""Filthy Rich"" by James Patterson that Trump banned Epstein from Mar-A-Lago in 1999. The problem is that there are pictures of Epstein and Trump at a party at Mar-A-Lago in the year 2000 (after his ""ban""). The lawyer in the case quoted the book. Trump banned Epstein only after all that shit came out in 2007. And not in 1999 when the first girl at Mar-A-Lago complained about that creep. I mean he called Epstein a ""terrific guy"" and ""a lot of fun to be with"" in 2002  which was after the first complains Trump received at his resort.

Oh  and how about Acosta? The guy who gave Epstein the sweetheard deal? “Miami’s top federal prosecutor  **Alexander Acosta** ” who was described as “a rising Republican star who had served in several White House posts before being named U.S. attorney in Miami by President George W. Bush”. During Epstein's case  he allowed Epstein to dictate the terms of his deal and blocked victims from knowing what was going on. This was recently taken up by a federal court looking into the sweetheart deal.  Then  in 2017  Trump [nominated](https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/speech/20170428) Alexander Acosta as labor secretary. Acosta was briefly questioned about the Epstein case during a [Senate confirmation hearing](https://www.help.senate.gov/hearings/nomination-of-alex-acosta-to-serve-as-secretary-of-labor) but he didn’t offer any new details. He was confirmed and [sworn in](https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/speech/20170428) and serves in that post today.   As part of the arrangement  Acosta agreed  despite [a federal law](https://www.justice.gov/usao/resources/crime-victims-rights-ombudsman/victims-rights-act) to the contrary  that the deal would be kept from the victims.   But court records reveal details of the negotiations and the role that Acosta would play in arranging the deal  which **scuttled the federal probe into a possible international sex trafficking operation**. Among other things  Acosta allowed Epstein’s lawyers unusual freedoms in dictating the terms of the non-prosecution agreement.",,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.038785885,35412,

Coupled with the American ""work or die"" attitude  a bunch of people leaving their jobs is going to galvanize our voters towards the Conservative candidates  not entreat them.  Remember  ~45% of the country actually supports Trump right now.  The major issue is that the American system has no vote of no confidence or recall election.  Once people get voted into power  they're in power until the next election.  If anything  massive displays of opposition just encourage them to push their agenda faster  since they know their time is limited.

However  if you look up the laws  it becomes clearer why they chose to go after the owner for abandoning the animals  since it isn't obvious that leaving animals in an overheated minivan would legally constitute animal cruelty in North Dakota. You might have to argue to a judge and jury that the owner was torturing the animals  or causing the prolonged impairment of the animals' health etc. Since the animals seem to have survived  and no one seems to believe the owner was intentionally attempting to torture them  it would be a very tough sell  and possibly overreach.   &#x200B;  [https://www.animallaw.info/statute/nd-cruelty-chapter-36-211-humane-treatment-animals#s202](https://www.animallaw.info/statute/nd-cruelty-chapter-36-211-humane-treatment-animals#s202),,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",-0.134259259,29957,

You said you're trying to educate people  please stop trying to educate them wrong. The cats in the car were not safe  their furry little lives were in danger.   A single cat in the same situation would not be happily sleeping. A single cat in the same situation would be overheated  and panting to no good effect (panting extra-hot air does not cool you off.) This was a physically life-threatening situation. A cat may be more comfortable out of doors (or indoors) at 90 degrees than a dog or human is  but not at 130+ degrees inside a car.

[according to this study](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.marketplace.org/2017/05/19/how-much-does-it-cost-send-someone-prison/amp/) it costs an average of $31 000 per year per convict. And then according [to this](https://www.humanservicesedu.org/social-work-salaries.html) the average local government social worker salary is $52 000. And deep [in this](https://datausa.io/profile/soc/211020/) they average a case load 17.8 people at a time. That means for one social worker it would cost the state $3000 total. BUT they’re assumed to be getting or trying to get a job to  so they’re actually paying taxes too. Gee I wonder why countries like Denmark that prioritize things like this are widely considered the happiest in the world and have such low recidivism rates compared to us and their economies aren’t based on Walmart jobs.  Edit: social worker salary is actually probably lower  like 49k - AND average inmate cost is probably higher.

Geck014,Parents going to the principals about me as a teacher after their child lies about something that happened in class,Does this happen to anyone else? This has happened to me a handful of times and it really makes me angry.   It happened last year a few times when a child would always go home and lie to his step mother about things I did or didn’t do in class e.g. if he felt another kid ‘bullied’ him when this original boy had been annoying the other boy and I didn’t discipline the other kid. She would come marching in and yell at me.   I am now working in a school in a different country  language and culture to my own.  This year parents have gone to the principal complain to the principal about me. The first instance was when I was given the instruction by my boss to let all children be immunised unless they had brought back the permission slip saying NOT to. Turns out one kid had already had got the injection and accidentally then got a second one  his parents flipped their shit and went straight to the principal about me. The day after they did this they found the permission slip he had not given them from a week ago was still sitting in his school bag.  Today a child’s parents went straight to the Principal about me after one of my students had been tripped another student last week and got massive scrapes on him.  It was a really busy lunchtime but I cleaned his wounds  bandaged him up  gave him some stickers and then sat him on a seat for the rest of the day. I spoke to the boy who tripped him and he said he was sorry and it was an ‘accident’.  When the boys sister came to pick him up I told her he had been tripped up by mistake  but I’d cleaned him up and put bandages on but he’s OK and might be a bit sore.   Anyway  today the parents came in and told the principal their child’s leg had swelled up over the weekend because I told him to keep the plaster on (why the hell would I say this)  they told me they weren’t informed that he was hurt) I told the big sister when she picked him up) and they were going on about the kid that tripped him (he insisted it was an accident and said sorry). Anyway I basically told them what really happened and they didn’t really say much after that. I think maybe they realised their kid had just made stuff up.   It really upsets me when they bypass me to go straight to my boss  only to be proven that their kid was lying or they were told the wrong information. I had an awful boss and team leader in the past so it gives me such bad anxiety whenever parents go to her first and she has to call me over.  So afterwards I spoke with the principal and I told her it really frustrates me that parents don’t come to me because it makes me look like I’m not doing my job properly. She said she knows I am and that’s why she got me to go in and chat to them about it because it didn’t sound right to her.   Anyway I’m going to give a notice out to parents to come to see me in the first instance if there are any issues as I’m the class teacher  and I can explain the actual situation that happened.  Anyone else get really angry when parents try to throw them under the bus like this? Just make me so mad.  Edit: Thanks everyone for all your suggestions! Will take the ones onboard that I can use. I live in a developing country at a local school in the islands so we have no use of computers  cell phones for contact with parents but I will definitely try to speak with them before/after school or send notes home for issues that happen!

A parent emailed my principal pictures of her child’s “swollen” eye (literally she was fine) after another kid bumped her face when he was raising his hand. The girl changed the story to “he stabbed me in the eye with a pencil” and the parent flipped out and went over my head about the “bullying” her child was enduring... so frustrating.

The principal gets to see what I'm dealing with and might save me the bother of it. Though I 100% agree it depends on your leader  I trust mine to have my back and also to be professional if I've stuffed up.  The immunisation complaint should go to the principal because their process was very flawed  you don't rely on a child doing the logistics for medical care.

In my district  fifth grade is all 1:1 with iPads  and it’s generally up to the teacher/school whether the kids can take iPads home or not. My partner teacher and I decided not to let them take them home. (For my class in particular  if they left the iPad at home  they would have a very hard time keeping up with classwork.)  Anyway  one of my students (a well-behaved  likeable fellow) told his parents that he was upset because his class didn’t get to take the iPads home  but the other class did (NOT TRUE) and that he didn’t like that I would sometime take away their extra recess because a few kids were talking (hint: it was most of them  and usually him  too). Well  his parents came into the principals office in a rage about all of this. Thank god she had my back  because my previous principal was all about taking the parents’ side about everything.

Geck014,Parents going to the principals about me as a teacher after their child lies about something that happened in class,Does this happen to anyone else? This has happened to me a handful of times and it really makes me angry.   It happened last year a few times when a child would always go home and lie to his step mother about things I did or didn’t do in class e.g. if he felt another kid ‘bullied’ him when this original boy had been annoying the other boy and I didn’t discipline the other kid. She would come marching in and yell at me.   I am now working in a school in a different country  language and culture to my own.  This year parents have gone to the principal complain to the principal about me. The first instance was when I was given the instruction by my boss to let all children be immunised unless they had brought back the permission slip saying NOT to. Turns out one kid had already had got the injection and accidentally then got a second one  his parents flipped their shit and went straight to the principal about me. The day after they did this they found the permission slip he had not given them from a week ago was still sitting in his school bag.  Today a child’s parents went straight to the Principal about me after one of my students had been tripped another student last week and got massive scrapes on him.  It was a really busy lunchtime but I cleaned his wounds  bandaged him up  gave him some stickers and then sat him on a seat for the rest of the day. I spoke to the boy who tripped him and he said he was sorry and it was an ‘accident’.  When the boys sister came to pick him up I told her he had been tripped up by mistake  but I’d cleaned him up and put bandages on but he’s OK and might be a bit sore.   Anyway  today the parents came in and told the principal their child’s leg had swelled up over the weekend because I told him to keep the plaster on (why the hell would I say this)  they told me they weren’t informed that he was hurt) I told the big sister when she picked him up) and they were going on about the kid that tripped him (he insisted it was an accident and said sorry). Anyway I basically told them what really happened and they didn’t really say much after that. I think maybe they realised their kid had just made stuff up.   It really upsets me when they bypass me to go straight to my boss  only to be proven that their kid was lying or they were told the wrong information. I had an awful boss and team leader in the past so it gives me such bad anxiety whenever parents go to her first and she has to call me over.  So afterwards I spoke with the principal and I told her it really frustrates me that parents don’t come to me because it makes me look like I’m not doing my job properly. She said she knows I am and that’s why she got me to go in and chat to them about it because it didn’t sound right to her.

It would also help if you were forthcoming in your level of experience and training.  That said  there likely two possibilities the parents are so assertive and aggressive.  One is that you're a foreigner  which they mayfeel intimidated by. They likely feel you won't understand them. So they go to the principal instead to air their greivences.  Second is that in some cultures  parents have authority over their child's education. So much so  they look for any excuse to demand their fees back. This can corrupt the merit of the child's education. Did the student actually lass or did the parent have some hand in this?  Further  if one parent threatens to sue the school  it could start a wave of all parents asking for their fees back. This sort of thing can actually break a school.  Such cultural instances here are usually found in developing countries  such as in SEA.  Other reasons could be the parents own experiences with foreigners  in your school before you arrived. Maybe there was some American who arrived in classes drunk  so forth.  In which case  you may feel you needn't take it personally.  The good news is  is that as you are a foreigner to that country  it would have cost a lot more money to hire you than it would a native teacher. Therefore  it will have to take a lot for them to fire you.  And you must have something they want for them to hire you in the first place.  Point is  it's really difficult to acheive anything when teaching in another country. Often  you just can't win.  You do need to build different interpersonal skills and be able to compromise your own standards with the culture.  Find your bottom line- are you there to make money  to explore another culture or to teach- and stick with it.

They care about what happens to them. If they come home and something happens in a way that they do not like or see as dangerous or whatever (a moving target for each parent) then they want to hold someone or something accountable.   I would argue it's pretty unavoidable because of the nature of the job  and I know we all have too much to do on a given day already  but if you open up the lines of communication to the parents and admin for these parents that are so hands on then you are covering your ass in multiple ways. You let the admin know what will happen when the parents come and how it looked on your side. You let the parents know what happens so they can compare to what the child said. And you are now blameless if they go over your head and confront you because then you have gone ahead and already reached out to them.   It's a rough spot  I understand. But parents that care will always be better than the parents who don't. I work in a pretty ""bad"" area where the parents couldn't be bothered a moment for how their child is doing and the students are acting out non-stop. So naturally I'll call and e-mail home constantly to have no reply and leave unheard voicemails. Then one day out of the blue  the child act better (for a short period of time) and I'll ask why and it's not because the parents wanted better of the student  but rather because the parent did not want to be bothered with voicemails and e-mails.",,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.05625,32759,

She would come marching in and yell at me.   I am now working in a school in a different country  language and culture to my own.  This year parents have gone to the principal complain to the principal about me. The first instance was when I was given the instruction by my boss to let all children be immunised unless they had brought back the permission slip saying NOT to. Turns out one kid had already had got the injection and accidentally then got a second one  his parents flipped their shit and went straight to the principal about me. The day after they did this they found the permission slip he had not given them from a week ago was still sitting in his school bag.  Today a child’s parents went straight to the Principal about me after one of my students had been tripped another student last week and got massive scrapes on him.  It was a really busy lunchtime but I cleaned his wounds  bandaged him up  gave him some stickers and then sat him on a seat for the rest of the day. I spoke to the boy who tripped him and he said he was sorry and it was an ‘accident’.  When the boys sister came to pick him up I told her he had been tripped up by mistake  but I’d cleaned him up and put bandages on but he’s OK and might be a bit sore.   Anyway  today the parents came in and told the principal their child’s leg had swelled up over the weekend because I told him to keep the plaster on (why the hell would I say this)  they told me they weren’t informed that he was hurt) I told the big sister when she picked him up) and they were going on about the kid that tripped him (he insisted it was an accident and said sorry). Anyway I basically told them what really happened and they didn’t really say much after that. I think maybe they realised their kid had just made stuff up.   It really upsets me when they bypass me to go straight to my boss  only to be proven that their kid was lying or they were told the wrong information. I had an awful boss and team leader in the past so it gives me such bad anxiety whenever parents go to her first and she has to call me over.  So afterwards I spoke with the principal and I told her it really frustrates me that parents don’t come to me because it makes me look like I’m not doing my job properly. She said she knows I am and that’s why she got me to go in and chat to them about it because it didn’t sound right to her.   Anyway I’m going to give a notice out to parents to come to see me in the first instance if there are any issues as I’m the class teacher  and I can explain the actual situation that happened.  Anyone else get really angry when parents try to throw them under the bus like this? Just make me so mad.  Edit: Thanks everyone for all your suggestions! Will take the ones onboard that I can use. I live in a developing country at a local school in the islands so we have no use of computers  cell phones for contact with parents but I will definitely try to speak with them before/after school or send notes home for issues that happen! I’ll also start a log book for any more major incidents so I know who to contact. Thanks for all your help!,self,No video,7/15/2019 21:16,40,59,14,windoverhill,A couple of suggestions. First in the future try to preemptively bond with the parents over anything you can think of about Johnny/Jenny: “Such imagination!” “She really loves math/sports/helping doesn’t she?” Not only will this put you and the parent on the same side  it will help you and little Johnny/Jenny bond a bit too. Do not underestimate the power of validating someone’s worth  even when you have to really work to find it. Second  get in the habit of documenting things that happen in the classroom especially once you’ve identified a problem area. It is a pain and will take more time than you want  but it will be SO helpful when you have to talk to That Parent  or worse.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.066346154,32760,

Many of these parents would be pissed if it happened to them.  It underscores a lack of value for our profession.  And of course none really apologize for going over ur head when they realize they are wrong bc in their mind it was extremely urgent and their actions were necessary.  I dont want to sound like i am blaming u for their actions bc clearly its a reflection of them.  However  id love to make some suggestions that have worked for me.  ive found that reaching out to all parents at the beginning if the year helps minimize this.  I text them and include their childs name in the text so i can easily search it later and provide updates.  I also include the term ""math teacher"" in my text so parents can search their texts easily as well.  (Or  i call to say hi and then follow up by text.) Each text emphasizes they can always reach out to me with any questions or concerns.  Another thing that has helped is even if the parent goes over ur head and everyone has to meet  always ask them if they have your contact info (phone  email or whatever) and offer to give it to them again.  Even tho theyve basically implied thru their actions that ur a heartless idiot (and none of us appreciate that)  it helps minimize this habit and maybe help educate the parent.  It doesnt feel satisfying to cater to this type of behavior but ultimately it helps me feel mpre peace w the issue.  It sounds like we may teach different age groups as well so hopefully you dont have as many ppl to reach out to.  Imo  personalized contact is better than a letter going home.  The latter may come across as condescending and close down communixation.  If u do send home that letter  id run it by ur principal first for last edits (in case parents go to him/her with complaints re: the letter).  Ultimately  each parent was worried about their kid and took the steps they thought were necessary.  Yes  their actions were laden w judgment  but none of us are perfect.",,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.147542735,32761,

I know it’s because I’m a young teacher (25 going into my 4th year teaching). What helps for me is communicating with the parents OFTEN. I send remind 101 messages at least every other day  I send notes home constantly (make sure some are positive like “caught you being awesome” awards)  I have students call parents the second something happens  etc. This way we already have a line of communication open so they are more likely to speak to me. Also  having the kids call is great because it doesn’t take any of my time. I have sticky notes on my desk  so if the parents want to talk to me I tell the kid to let them know I’ll call back after school and then the kid puts a sticky on my computer as a reminder. I absolutely will not get on the phone while I’m in class. I just explain that during that time  my attention is already divided 25 ways. However  I would still love to speak with them  so if they want a follow up I’ll call after school when they can have 100% of my attention.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.226818182,32763,

I know how busy you probably already are  so this may not be realistic for you  but if you have time to be proactive about communicating with parents it might help them develop a better picture of what’s going on and feel natural about reaching out to you first. For example  if a kid gets injured call the parents as soon as you have a chance just to give them a heads up about what happened and how it’s been handled (and if kid is okay  let them know like Hey Ms B  it’s Tommy’s teacher. Just wanted to give you a heads up that on the playground today Tommy and another kid collided during tag and Tommy scraped his knee up. He’s okay  we got his knee cleaned up and he’s got a bandaid and he’s back to playing with friends now  but I’ll keep an eye on it this afternoon. Do you have any questions? Ok thanks  let me know if anything else comes up”.   About the “bullying”  I had a kid this year who insisted to his mom that his friend was bullying him when really they were good friends but fought all the time and it went both ways. The mom wasn’t rude about it  just let me know she was worried  so I thanked her for telling me  and told her I would watch for it  then would occasionally update her about what I observed  including a message the next day letting her know I watched the boys interaction closely the next couple days  they consistently chose to play together and I didn’t notice any bullying from the other boy  although I did witness her son taunting the other boy about knocking over his tower and so I separated them. If I did see any problems between the boys  I would also send her a quick message or tell her in person at pick up  like “hey just so you know  this afternoon Ike and Devi had a disagreement when Devi wouldnt share his blocks and Ike called him a name.  We talked about sharing and name calling and they decided they would take a break from playing together for a bit  but they seem to have made up and wanted to sit together at snack. Let me know if anything else comes up or you have any questions.”   It’s hard for parents when they don’t really know or see what’s going on for their kid all day  and lots of parents assume their kids are angels and that they would never lie or skew stories for pity/attention/to get out of trouble  and it’s a hard choice to decide your kid is lying and risk being wrong and damaging that relationship.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.071428571,32765,

My guide teacher had a binder she used instead.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.068888889,32766,
Geck014,Parents going to the principals about me as a teacher after their child lies about something that happened in class,Does this happen to anyone else? This has happened to me a handful of times and it really makes me angry.   It happened last year a few times when a child would always go home and lie to his step mother about things I did or didn’t do in class e.g. if he felt another kid ‘bullied’ him when this original boy had been annoying the other boy and I didn’t discipline the other kid. She would come marching in and yell at me.   I am now working in a school in a different country  language and culture to my own.  This year parents have gone to the principal complain to the principal about me. The first instance was when I was given the instruction by my boss to let all children be immunised unless they had brought back the permission slip saying NOT to. Turns out one kid had already had got the injection and accidentally then got a second one  his parents flipped their shit and went straight to the principal about me. The day after they did this they found the permission slip he had not given them from a week ago was still sitting in his school bag.  Today a child’s parents went straight to the Principal about me after one of my students had been tripped another student last week and got massive scrapes on him.  It was a really busy lunchtime but I cleaned his wounds  bandaged him up  gave him some stickers and then sat him on a seat for the rest of the day. I spoke to the boy who tripped him and he said he was sorry and it was an ‘accident’.  When the boys sister came to pick him up I told her he had been tripped up by mistake  but I’d cleaned him up and put bandages on but he’s OK and might be a bit sore.   Anyway  today the parents came in and told the principal their child’s leg had swelled up over the weekend because I told him to keep the plaster on (why the hell would I say this)  they told me they weren’t informed that he was hurt) I told the big sister when she picked him up) and they were going on about the kid that tripped him (he insisted it was an accident and said sorry). Anyway I basically told them what really happened and they didn’t really say much after that. I think maybe they realised their kid had just made stuff up.   It really upsets me when they bypass me to go straight to my boss  only to be proven that their kid was lying or they were told the wrong information. I had an awful boss and team leader in the past so it gives me such bad anxiety whenever parents go to her first and she has to call me over.  So afterwards I spoke with the principal and I told her it really frustrates me that parents don’t come to me because it makes me look like I’m not doing my job properly. She said she knows I am and that’s why she got me to go in and chat to them about it because it didn’t sound right to her.   Anyway I’m going to give a notice out to parents to come to see me in the first instance if there are any issues as I’m the class teacher  and I can explain the actual situation that happened.  Anyone else get really angry when parents try to throw them under the bus like this? Just make me so mad.  Edit: Thanks everyone for all your suggestions! Will take the ones onboard that I can use. I live in a developing country at a local school in the islands so we have no use of computers  cell phones for contact with parents but I will definitely try to speak with them before/after school or send notes home for issues that happen! I’ll also start a log book for any more major incidents so I know who to contact.

See if you can look at this a different way: let your admin screen these problems for you  so you don't have to be bothered unless they have questions.  Not having to deal directly with angry parents is one of the benefits they can provide for you.  Beyond that  I'll just echo what others have said: preemptively communicate with parents  and document everything with objective facts.  Getting pulled into the emotion is just encouraging some parents.  You don't want to volunteer yourself to be part of the drama.  When you're dealing with someone who is being emotional  be the adult in the room who points out the facts.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",-0.007142857,32767,

Geck014,Parents going to the principals about me as a teacher after their child lies about something that happened in class,Does this happen to anyone else? This has happened to me a handful of times and it really makes me angry.   It happened last year a few times when a child would always go home and lie to his step mother about things I did or didn’t do in class e.g. if he felt another kid ‘bullied’ him when this original boy had been annoying the other boy and I didn’t discipline the other kid. She would come marching in and yell at me.   I am now working in a school in a different country  language and culture to my own.  This year parents have gone to the principal complain to the principal about me. The first instance was when I was given the instruction by my boss to let all children be immunised unless they had brought back the permission slip saying NOT to. Turns out one kid had already had got the injection and accidentally then got a second one  his parents flipped their shit and went straight to the principal about me. The day after they did this they found the permission slip he had not given them from a week ago was still sitting in his school bag.  Today a child’s parents went straight to the Principal about me after one of my students had been tripped another student last week and got massive scrapes on him.  It was a really busy lunchtime but I cleaned his wounds  bandaged him up  gave him some stickers and then sat him on a seat for the rest of the day. I spoke to the boy who tripped him and he said he was sorry and it was an ‘accident’.  When the boys sister came to pick him up I told her he had been tripped up by mistake  but I’d cleaned him up and put bandages on but he’s OK and might be a bit sore.   Anyway  today the parents came in and told the principal their child’s leg had swelled up over the weekend because I told him to keep the plaster on (why the hell would I say this)  they told me they weren’t informed that he was hurt) I told the big sister when she picked him up) and they were going on about the kid that tripped him (he insisted it was an accident and said sorry). Anyway I basically told them what really happened and they didn’t really say much after that. I think maybe they realised their kid had just made stuff up.   It really upsets me when they bypass me to go straight to my boss  only to be proven that their kid was lying or they were told the wrong information. I had an awful boss and team leader in the past so it gives me such bad anxiety whenever parents go to her first and she has to call me over.  So afterwards I spoke with the principal and I told her it really frustrates me that parents don’t come to me because it makes me look like I’m not doing my job properly. She said she knows I am and that’s why she got me to go in and chat to them about it because it didn’t sound right to her.   Anyway I’m going to give a notice out to parents to come to see me in the first instance if there are any issues as I’m the class teacher  and I can explain the actual situation that happened.  Anyone else get really angry when parents try to throw them under the bus like this? Just make me so mad.  Edit: Thanks everyone for all your suggestions! Will take the ones onboard that I can use.

I used to tell my student teachers to channel their inner Beyoncé. Beyoncé doesn’t chase her fans looking for approval - they chase her. So don’t be so quick to apologize or explain. Develop a poker face. Pass out business cards at the beginning of the school year and set limits about when you are available to answer questions. Instead of rushing to explain things  use the poker face and ask ‘ Can you tell me more about that?’  Or ‘Can you give me more context around  what Theon Greyjoy told you.’  As a society  we seem to automatically assume that older people already have these boundaries  and that works in favour of the older teacher. But you can build them. Start with practicing your Clint Eastwood stone face. (I know this makes me sound like a jerk  but you will get pulled in far too many directions to be effective if you don’t set limits.),,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.292820513,32777,

Geck014,Parents going to the principals about me as a teacher after their child lies about something that happened in class,Does this happen to anyone else? This has happened to me a handful of times and it really makes me angry.   It happened last year a few times when a child would always go home and lie to his step mother about things I did or didn’t do in class e.g. if he felt another kid ‘bullied’ him when this original boy had been annoying the other boy and I didn’t discipline the other kid. She would come marching in and yell at me.   I am now working in a school in a different country  language and culture to my own.  This year parents have gone to the principal complain to the principal about me. The first instance was when I was given the instruction by my boss to let all children be immunised unless they had brought back the permission slip saying NOT to. Turns out one kid had already had got the injection and accidentally then got a second one  his parents flipped their shit and went straight to the principal about me. The day after they did this they found the permission slip he had not given them from a week ago was still sitting in his school bag.  Today a child’s parents went straight to the Principal about me after one of my students had been tripped another student last week and got massive scrapes on him.  It was a really busy lunchtime but I cleaned his wounds  bandaged him up  gave him some stickers and then sat him on a seat for the rest of the day. I spoke to the boy who tripped him and he said he was sorry and it was an ‘accident’.  When the boys sister came to pick him up I told her he had been tripped up by mistake  but I’d cleaned him up and put bandages on but he’s OK and might be a bit sore.   Anyway  today the parents came in and told the principal their child’s leg had swelled up over the weekend because I told him to keep the plaster on (why the hell would I say this)  they told me they weren’t informed that he was hurt) I told the big sister when she picked him up) and they were going on about the kid that tripped him (he insisted it was an accident and said sorry). Anyway I basically told them what really happened and they didn’t really say much after that. I think maybe they realised their kid had just made stuff up.   It really upsets me when they bypass me to go straight to my boss  only to be proven that their kid was lying or they were told the wrong information. I had an awful boss and team leader in the past so it gives me such bad anxiety whenever parents go to her first and she has to call me over.  So afterwards I spoke with the principal and I told her it really frustrates me that parents don’t come to me because it makes me look like I’m not doing my job properly. She said she knows I am and that’s why she got me to go in and chat to them about it because it didn’t sound right to her.   Anyway I’m going to give a notice out to parents to come to see me in the first instance if there are any issues as I’m the class teacher  and I can explain the actual situation that happened.

Not all of them  but more than in previous generations  and they tend to be the vocal ones.  They don't come to the teacher because they see the teacher as the threat  so they go to the administrator hoping that the threat will be removed/taken care of.  They have no idea that it makes being nice to their kid just a little bit harder  and if you told them  they would take it as further evidence that you are a threat to their child.  Separating the kid from the behavior of the parent is one of the many challenges of teaching.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.19212963,32785,

I can recommend it. It definitely had *some* high tier schools  but most were more mid/lower tier (or start-up schools). My understanding is that the Iowa fair is more for recent grads with minimal experience.   &#x200B;  With your experience  I would go to one of the Search Associates fairs. Search Associates has the highest tier schools. It's very competitive  but with your experience and licensure areas you can be picky with where you go- lots of schools will want you.

Recruiting for the coming year began last January and should largely be over.  International schools recruit much earlier than stateside schools partially to avoid the added recruiting competition from local schools but primarily because most people need time to pack up and to move abroad.    I am a product of the international schools (Ghana  Thailand  and El Salvador. As an adult I attended two ISS job fairs and wound up first in Saudi Arabia and then in Beirut  Lebanon. I am told that Search Associates is now much larger than ISS. The UNI job fair was held late January through early February.  Teaching abroad is a great way to see the world. Since most countries are smaller than the U.S. and are geographically closer  it's easy to spend weekends abroad. Better  yet are the extended holidays for Spring Break and Christmas.   During my last teaching assignment abroad  I spent Christmas on an Egyptian paddle steamer and cruised down the Nile. I spent Spring Break touring Syria.   All told  I've spent 17 years abroad. As much as I enjoyed the expat life  I'm glad to be stateside and am happier yet to own my own home and to no longer have to live in furnished faculty apartments.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.185263348,33272,

You will have the same delightful mix of interesting cool kids at this school as you would at any other school. I think the biggest generalization you could make is that probably many of the students speak Spanish at home and will also feel more comfortable speaking Spanish with each other at school. Have you participated in training about students who are bilingual? It's really important to know that if they speak their home language at school or during class THAT IS HELPFUL FOR THEIR LEARNING. I am a bilingual teacher at a title 1 school and some of the monolingual teachers assume that students are off task if they are speaking Spanish when usually they are actually using their home language to help themselves understand the content of the class.

For the most part be yourself. Maintain a strong relationship with parents and things will go smoothly. The parents will have your back as long as you demonstrate you care. The difference between this population and others is that parents don’t always communicate well. There is usually a cultural and language barrier. Some of these kids come with serious baggage. Many come from tough backgrounds so you got to be empathetic to their needs. Most importantly  Never be friends! These kids think they can relate to you but they can also use it against you. Be firm and make sure you develop structure. Rules are everything with these students. Learn everything you can about their backgrounds. It makes a huge difference to know where they are from. Many are at risk youth and are from low poverty backgrounds. Just be safe and vigilant. Stay cool!  P.S.

My experience with parents is that they dont really communicate openly with or trust admin and teachers who dont speak spanish. I'm white but usually when they realize i speak fluent spanish  they open up and are happy to be involved. Which obviously makes sense. I have taught in title 1 schools for 13 years. Yes you do hear horror stories and yes your first year is going to be fucking awful and exhausting. But the fact that you are teaching in a setting similar to what you grew up in is awesome. If you can make it through the first few years and keep a really positive attitude and always believe in the kids then it is an awesome job. I hate when admin and teachers say ""the parents arent involved."" Well I find that many of my students parents who are immigrants obviously have taken huge risks just for their kids to get their education so even if they arent involved in the way we would expect I think that many them are incredibly dedicated to their kids education and it's our job as teachers to find ways to involve them that they can engage with.

For math work I usually write something like ""con"" for ""conversion factor"" or ""imp"" which I honestly don't know why I couldn't come up with something better  but it means ""improper math"" which means a number of things. It's what I write when I really don't want to write out a sentence on why their Algebra is wrong. They usually come up to me to ask specifically about that  but they learn very quickly that coming to **me** means they will have to answer about 5-6 questions before they get an answer from me. So they go to each other to figure it out.  &#x200B;  Just curious if anyone else has something like this that they do. It honestly cuts down on grading time and it's not hard to get the hang of. Just make up your own code and you should be good. Grade for a little while without it and see what you are *constantly* making comments on.  I honestly grade *more* with the code. I even code things that I'm not going to put into the grade book because it's just quick and I can give the kids feedback.",self,No video,7/15/2019 9:55,19,13,18,TemporaryGrass,I get it - that’s on your school.

My alma mater changed how they do education degrees to either primary  secondary  special ed  or early childhood education with specialized tracks based on what you want to teach. Secondary tracks in particular changed and degrees sound a little bit like what you just listed.  I don't know what college in particular you're talking about and how their curriculum/course study works so I can't get into the specifics but what that degree is essentially entailing is this. You'll learn all the science and theory of teaching in addition to the philosophies and major schools of thought. Alongside those courses  you'll be taking rigorous math courses and super specialized math courses. In my case  I took a lot of literary theory classes and specialized writing classes.  I once compared my degree to a sort of (but not exactly) double major. I took a lot of classes that an English major would take but I also took a lot of education related classes as well. It's half education and half your subject area if that makes sense.  Let me know if you've got any other questions!

It's fine if you have one assailant  but if you have multiple people breaking in / beating you  a modern firearm design vastly increases survivability. Additionally for people with low grip strength (old  sick  etc.) It is difficult to shoot a revolver accurately in combat / self defense applications do to the double action trigger pull. Finally  a good defensive revolver costs substantially more than a good modern defensive handgun  so it will disproportionately effect poor people.   IMO it should be like cars  it's the best compromise. If you buy a car for use on private property  you don't have to have a license or register it. If you want to drive on a public road  you need a license. This is basically how it is set up now  you have to have a license only if you want to carry in public. The downside is requiring a license generally comes with the state charging a fee  which allows them to effectively disarm poor people  who are the most likely to live in areas with violent crime.   I think registration is pointless since 99.999 percent of guns are owned by law abiding people  and having that data will not do anything to actually reduce crime / murder rate since you can't tell preemptively if someone will misuse it. What it will allow is for the government to harass minorities and other groups  and make it easier for an all out confiscation.   The best thing you can do to reduce accidental gun deaths is to teach firearms safety in schools one day out of the year once kids hit the age of 13 or so. It's similar to how we know teaching proper sex ed reduces teen pregnancies  not teaching it won't do anything to prevent it.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.082598542,40577,

According to the Human Development Index  in the *developed world* the US is ***by far*** the worst in homicides by firearm per 1 million people at 29.7. Next is Switzerland at 7.7 (a quarter of the US). Funny how the stats change when you compare like for like.  On average  assaults in the US are 3 times more likely to involve guns than other developed nations.  Gun homicide rates are over 25 times higher in the US than other high-income countries.  The US is one of 6 nations that make up more than half of **all** gun deaths worldwide  2nd behind Brazil.  The US also has by far the highest number of privately owned guns in the world. The number of civilian-owned firearms in the US was 120.5 guns per 100 residents  meaning there were more firearms than people. The world’s second-ranked country was Yemen  a quasi-failed state torn by civil war  where there were 52.8 guns per 100 residents.  The US holds 5% of the globe's population  but 31% of the globe's mass shooters.  > the U.S. ranks 31st in gun violence.  Even when you ignore relevant comparison to take in the rest of the world (deaths per 100 000) the US is 20th  not 31st.  > School shootings includes any shooting that takes place near campus or on campus including suicide.  The US has had 57 times as many school shootings as the other major industrialised nations combined. Near or on campus  suicide or not  it's a **big** problem.  > Most deaths from guns are suicides with only a small percentage being homicides.  Entirely irrelevant.

The police still do their jobs to reduce this number through normal police work by finding people who haven't handed in the illegal weapons and allowing the courts to deal with them. Now lets say someone wants to do mass harm but isn't one of the 3% of people who did not go along with the buy back law before the buyback they would legally purchase a firearm capable of doing so or would steal one from the people who legally own them.

Venezuela took the guns  Brazil took the guns  and in Mexico guns for private use can only be purchased in very specific manners.  To even imply that these countries aren't developed is incorrect and insulting to the countries themselves.  https://www.thetrace.org/2018/04/highest-murder-rates-us-cities-list/  https://gyazo.com/d3df095904d83658f69bdc957bb53bab  All cities with high gun deaths per capita are in cities with very strict gun laws.  > Completely false. California is considered has having the tightest gun laws in the US (eg. California bans the open carry of guns and requires background checks on private firearm sales) and is around 30th in the US for gun deaths per 100 000 people. Additionally  65% of the guns recovered in the most restrictive states originated from other states - they cross state lines from areas with fewer restrictions.  Chicago has the strictest gun laws  all other cities cited and sourced have the strictest gun laws. And Chicago is where most gun homicides are actually occurring.  So again twisting to your argument so that your statistics appear more accurate than they actually are. Keep cherry picking.

Building relationships will always be more powerful than a power trip. Be you  let them be them  and make your expectations clear and concise. The kids will rise to meet you.

Routines are things the kids do every day. Procedures are things they do some of the time. Most of your behavior issues will be solved with very specific routines and procedures. Both need to be taught for your class. What's the routine for walking into class? How do they turn in work? What do they do if they need the restroom? Can they get out of their seat and sharpen a pencil? How much can they talk during work time?      And then whatever you decide you have to practice it with them... many times over. I spend a whole class period at the beginning of the year practicing walking into class  getting their book  and sitting in their spot. Spend the time in the beginning of the year  it'll save you time later.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.271428571,32672,

Love what you teach.  Love who you teach and love teaching.    2. Do the paperwork every day and on time.  That keeps the stress level down.    3. Keep it professional. Dress professionally   act professionally and expect to be treated professionally.   Keep a professional relationship with the kids.  They don't need a friend they need a teacher.    4. Ask for help from everyone for everything   from the principal to the lunch ladies.    5. You are human.   You are going to make mistakes.   Keep a journal.  Write them down and how you would do it better next year.  Next year you are going to really be glad you did  6.  The kids are going to push you until you break.  That's normal.   Don't break down in front of the kids.  At the end of the day. Lock the door   turn off the lights and cry your eyes out.  Then take a deep breath.  Remember that they're just kids and get back to work.    7. You are there to raise them up. Don't let them drag you down.  Arguing with a student is like wrestling with a pig.

You can of course use an online version of a calendar. But since my course is taught chronologically I simply take the number of chapters and spread them throughout the year (you will need to school calendar so holidays  state test dates  assemblies  etc can be planned in.) This will become part of your “scope and sequence” (the scope of what you need to teach and the order you do it.) This calendar is the back bone of ALL my lesson planning.   Then I tailor my classroom agreement. This document lays out all of my expectations for the year. We go over it the first day and kids take it home for a parents signature. This is where I put all classroom room rules. After kids bring them back I make a copy and we glue it into their journal. I do this so it is there for their reference at all times. (And I don’t like to have posted rules in my classroom.) This will establish expectations day one.   If you have a copy of Harry Wong’s book in class procedures  I strongly suggest that you skim it.

Become familiar with your state standards and check out your departments curriculum.  Talk to admin or other teachers to find out of school wide expectations or rules ( some schools have a behavior plan  require you to turn in a syllabus  or have a set activity they do on the first day of school  etc.)  Work on your syllabus.  Include grading scales  policy on late work  class rules  materials lists.  Again  check with school and department as different schools give different amounts of flexibity.  Check your department for a backbone pacing guide or make your own.  Plan for the first 3 or 4 weeks knowing that it won't go exactly as planned.  Have a detailed week one and a general plan for the following weeks which you will finish as they approach.  Make copies for the first week.  Decide on the format for your assignments (interactive notwbboks  binders  loose and turn in daily/weekly   etc).   Learn to use you gradebook.  Decorate your classroom.

Remember no matter how this year goes the next years will be better. Not that this year will be bad  but it takes some experience to really get into your groove.  The biggest thing I had to work on was classroom rules. Have your Expectations of your students (be respectful  come to class prepared  etc) clearly presented to your students and be Consistent with enforcing them. Enforcing is a harsh word so instead we say ""Redirect the student"" making sure they are aware of the expectations  usually done in private.  As far as lesson planning goes you want to backwards design starting with what the students are required to learn at the state level. Maybe there is a State Test the students take  or look up your state's 6th grade standards.  Save everything! I use Google Drive to save everything I make just in case I want to use it or modify it later.  Classroom culture is very important so that the students feel safe and able to express themselves without ridicule. So maybe balance your belief system and culture creation with curriculum and lesson planning.  Again Congratulations!

I actually found the plan in my dropbox and pasted it in here. So many of these procedures broke down pretty fast.   &#x200B;  My Plan  \------------------------------  First Day – Math 5th grade– period 1 - Room 201      **Central Focus**  Students   will learn the expectations  procedures and routines of the class.       **Opening Routine/Activities**  **(8:50-8:57)**  Greet students at door.  “Good Morning- Please find your   assigned seat and silently read over the syllabus.” Hand syllabus   Seating chart projected + hard copy   in case there are issues     **Main Learning Activities (8:57- 9:23)**     **Directions for Class:**  The teacher overviews and projects the expectations   for entry. (4 minutes)  1. Silently line up along the wall   outside of Ms. \*\*\*\*’s room  2. Greet Ms. \*\*\*\* and enter the   classroom silently  3. Take Do Now and walk to your assigned  seat  4. Take out any homework and materials  you will need  5. Start Do Now silently   6. If you have a question or need  something  raise your hand  **Begin the Task:**  Discuss rationale for entry   procedure and practice. (2 minutes)   I direct students to practice   entry. (6 minutes)  **Directions for Class:**  The teacher overviews and projects the expectations   for passing papers back. (3 minutes)  1. Pass the papers up each column to   the front of the room.  2. Once all the papers from a column   have reached the front row  pass the papers to the right.   The teacher overviews and projects the expectations   for passing papers to the teacher. (3 minutes)  **Directions for Class:**  The teacher overviews and projects the expectations  for participation and discussions.   1. Active listening   2. Respect  3. On task   Introduce clap. Talk with partner.   (2 minutes)   Clap (5 minutes)     **Closure Assessment**  **(9:23-9:30)**  Students write   down tomorrow’s homework  then complete and submit exit slip.  &#x200B;  RESULTS:   Students did not know the word syllabus so that confuses them. That passing papers thing was not reinforced and the diagram of how to do it was a waste. Later  I just would pick one or two students to collect or pass back stuff. The clap thing was a call for attention but I kept messing up the clap pattern. I've change it since to 'If you hear me  clap once...If you hear me clap twice...If you hear me clap three times..."" until everyone is doing it.  Silent entry is important. It did break down but if I could go back  I'd forget all the paper passing and focus on entering the class respectfully and make sure I was reinforcing the procedure every day. How students enter the class is super important. Chaotic entry = chaotic class.   &#x200B;  If you can get another teacher's info  preferably in your department and/or grade level  you should reach out and ask them for help about planning for the first day and what to expect.",,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.127766106,31921,

Prep yourself as best you can for September. Review curriculum  plan ahead if you have that luxury.  Truthfully though  you will be taking it one day at a time  one class at a time.  **September is all about developing procedures**.  How do you want students to come in to your class? How do you want them to leave? How will you tell them what they need at the beginning of class? How do you want them to answer questions - raise their hand? Participation sticks? (sticks is better!) Think through all the actions of a student on their first day  and write down what you want their behaviour to be.  I literally had lessons on how to take the chromebooks from the cart and put them back.  A concocted premise  like ""make a video of yourself speaking french"" or something  but yeah - multiple lessons on the most basic of classroom functioning.  *The First Days of School* has multiple things that can help you with developing these procedures.  Rather than you coming up with the rules (Which are generally set by the school  in any case)  instead develop a lesson plan for having the students come up with class norms - expectations for behaviour in class.  I can't find mine at the moment  but this page has three really good ideas for this: [https://theartofeducation.edu/2017/08/08/3-benefits-creating-classroom-expectations-students/](https://theartofeducation.edu/2017/08/08/3-benefits-creating-classroom-expectations-students/)  Take the time to think through how you want your class to be set up.  To that plan  add a clock where you can see it with important times posted just for you  so you can keep track of the day.  I set up google calendar on my phone to chime when I had five minutes left in class  which was my ""tell them to put everything away"" signal.  What are you going to do to get to know the students  and get to know their names?  I used circles and comic strips - What was a time you got hurt/how could you have avoided it? makes for funny comic strips (literally four panels: two of the accident  one of how you took care of the injury  and one of how you could have avoided it.)  There are several resources online for talking circle procedures and questions.  Marking...k  so this how I made it through this past year (my first).  I wanted to write all the comments I'm supposed to  right? With the whole objective-what you did-what you could do structure and everything.  By Christmas I was a wreck and still had a six inch stack of marking. So my dad (former teacher  principal  and classroom behaviour specialist) sat me down and told me to pick one paper  ideally from a solid or good student and mark it.  Just the number - no comments.  He then told me to take the next paper and compare it to the first - was it better  or worse?  Great! Give that one a number accordingly.  Then the next  then the next.  This procedure  of using one as an archetype and point of reference made marking go much faster.  See I was not and am not *yet* at the point where I can give the full script of comments quickly and succinctly.  I am not there yet.  I will be  but not right now. For now  the students get a number on a page and I add only the comments to the ones who really need it or who really missed the mark.  I will get better  I am only starting out.  And so I have to cut myself a lot of slack when it comes to a great many things.  I am still learning them  I am not an expert  **I will get there.**   The other thing I learned about marking is about rubrics  and I got this from one of the board coaches: do not write a four-point rubric (we have a 4-3-2-1 grading system in intermediate)  only write the conditions for a 3 (outcome met).  A student can tell what is adding more or going beyond meeting the outcome  and they can tell what is only partially  or minimally understanding the outcome.  Let them fill in the blanks in their minds  I only need the explanation of how to obtain a 3.  So clear  one-point rubrics and using one paper as an archetype are my advice.",,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.183880679,31923,

Keep in mind that it's not always a great idea to teach rules and procedures day 1  because everyone else will do that and kids will be overwhelmed. Also  schedules aren't always finalized the first few days  so the kids in your classes may change slightly.   The first week or so should include building relationships  collecting baseline data  and establishing classroom management. So create like 3-5 solid lessons to build classroom community then worry about curriculum. Like you could honestly spend a whole day practicing how to walk into class  attention getters  etc.   Feel free to DM me if you need extra idea.

For me  this boils down to the question “What is  your goal/reason for giving the test?”  Some kiddos just don’t do well on tests. It’s a fact. I  myself suck at timed exams which involve writing. Other people have testing anxiety (even at a young age). Still more are able to demonstrate skills in less formal settings  but cant when given pen and paper. And this doesn’t even take into account the idiosyncrasies of creating assessments and assessment rubrics (and the many prevailing failings that these often have).   I work with young children (elementary aged) where my grades are supposed to be indicative of a student’s ability to demonstrate a given skill  as laid out by our state standards. For example  in kindergarten (that’s the report card template I happen to have handy) it specifies things like “identifies 52 letters” “correctly names 2D and 3D shapes” or “states the city  state  and country in which the student lives.” I don’t care where  when or how they demonstrate these skills so much as if they CAN they demonstrate them. I do give formal assessments  but  if I notice that a student isn’t performing  I check my informal data  reteach  and reassess. My grades are a combination of these two factors.   This mentality rolls over when I am working with higher grades (4th/5th) too. I do allow my kiddos to have one retake on any given test. This “retake” comes in two different forms. One  they take their test and correct their mistakes writing me a short (typically no more than a few sentences) reason for WHY their original answer was wrong. With this option they cannot receive higher than a B grade. Two  they are given a completely new test to take  in which case I take the higher of the two grades. All students are able to take advantage of this system and students who failed the original test are required to complete the retake.  For me  a test is a measure of the students’ growth and it is more important for me that they learn the skill than what grade I put in my book.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.118591083,31363,

Something always changes or there is a better idea  or more likely the district requirements change.  &#x200B;  The district has been moving toward a standards based grading and student self progression (meaning students can sort of work at their own pace but still have dates for tests and finals). I personally believe there is nothing wrong with retaking a test. If it were just my decision I would offer unlimited retakes  just with strict requirements.  1. Students must have all work completed. If you haven't been doing your work then you only get the one try. 2. Students must prove to me (and this is really subjective) that they have mastered their mistakes and are ready to try and prove it on an assessment. This is usually corrections as well as a little sit down so the student can verbally explain their thought process to me. 3. The highest score on a retake is a 90%.

Lots of it sounds like scientists/engineers were aware of ways that contamination could have made it through processes  but no evidence that any batches contaminated with asbestos actually did make it through the controls.  The specific links to cancer seem a little weak with one researcher standing by the claim that they raise risk by 30% in a rare form of cancer. (That would be something like the risk going from 10/million to 13/million  not 30% of people using the product get cancer. ) And other researchers saying there's no link.  Also somewhat interesting to me is the fact that I've never seen a prop 65 warning on baby powder. Given that the state of California knows everything causes cancer  the lack of warning stands out.

The science of bite-mark comparisons  ballistic comparisons  fingerprint matching  blood-spatter analysis  arson investigation and other common forensic techniques has been tainted by systematic error  cognitive bias (sometimes called “tunnel vision”) and little or no research or data to support it. There is  in short  very little science behind some of the forensic “sciences” used in court to imprison and sometimes execute people.   > Forensic science’s shortcomings have left the justice system alternately in a quiet panic or massive denial. The issue was first brought into the spotlight by a highly critical report from the National Academy of Sciences in 2009  which found a dearth of scientific backing for most forensics methods other than DNA. It cited evidence that “faulty forensic science analyses may have contributed to wrongful convictions of innocent people.” That report was followed by an even more blistering presidential commission report in 2016  which found serious errors and junk science in a host of commonly used forensic methods tying suspects to crimes.

Turns out that with modern equipment and much more sensitive tests there were trace amounts present in some of the talc supplies.  Are they a health hazard in such trace quantities?

This was straight deception. Their marketing was and is  *this product is safe for babies so you know it’s safe for you*. Except  they knew it wasn’t safe but sold it anyway. They went out of their way to market to certain communities more than others  knowing it was unsafe.   Your argument is ‘well  not everything can be 100%.’   Like  wtf?  Edit: And just to point out  the reason the Flint water crisis was so shocking was not only because the bureaucrats lied. It was because their lies caused children to get lead poisoning. Meaning  when a household product can at any point harm children  it needs to be removed or corrected as quickly as possible. The answer is not  “Oh well sometimes that happens”. It doesn’t “just happen”. It’s because someone went out of their way to be a dick.   And for the record  no one should be questioning their water in the United States.
