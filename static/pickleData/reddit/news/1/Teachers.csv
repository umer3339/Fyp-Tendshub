I think it's because there are so many uncertainties about the first day. Who are going to be my ""problem kids""? What will the chemistry be like in my classes? Will the chemistry be positive or negative?   Since I teach Culinary Arts  half of my budget is dependent upon student lab fees. Every year I worry about the ability of my students to pay their lab fees because I work at a Title I school. Although I understand that some of them may not be able to pay their fees  the sad reality is that I need money to buy culinary supplies at the local supermarket. While the school will kick in some of the funds that students can't pay  the school budget can't cover every kid who is short on lab fees. If there's too much of a shortfall  it will affect my ability to be in the kitchen 4 days out of 5. It could also affect what we do in the kitchen.  Next August will be my 30th year as a teacher and my experience has taught me that it doesn't get any better as I get older.

I’ve never taught at a year round school but in my personal experience the first day of preschool is always a bit of a shit show. I would get anxious over my plans for helping kids separate  introducing recess rules  etc. But I would also get really excited. I got to go back to doing what I love and I’m good at.  For the sleep I try gentle sleep aids (sleepy time tea  melatonin) but never anything like Advil PM because I’m afraid I would sleep through my alarm. Beyond that I just accept that I’m going to be tired and hunker down with a good TV show or book. That and remind myself that this too shall pass and then I don’t have to have another first day for a whole year!,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.05497076023391812,31206,

I have to say THANK YOU op for sharing the Teach Like a Cat link. In college I learned so much about how to keep my switch in the “on” position and be constantly engaging—very “Teach Like A Pirate.” I wonder if the professors taught us that because we were all still pretty young and they assumed we could bring endless buckets of energy into the classroom.   I tried that during my student teaching experience. Despite the fact that I’m a naturally high energy person  I’m also naturally introverted and found myself completely exhausted by stretching myself to the limit every day. By the end of my experience  I started to mix in calmer days because I just had to. It seemed like my students appreciated my “realness” a lot more than when I was putting on a show.  Admittedly  I’ve been nervous all Summer about how to find the balance between the two. I’m nervous about a lot of things...setting the right boundaries and expectations early on  communicating with difficult parents  building a connection with my students that makes them feel comfortable and safe in my classroom  etc etc etc. But thanks so much for sharing something that made me a little less nervous about the perceived pressure on my daily “performance”  :),,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.11666125541125542,31216,

153,half_a_sleep,Is it just me  or do you guys have trouble sleeping before the first day back at work after vacation?,"Year round teacher here and I just went back to work this past Friday. 2020 will be my 10th year teaching the same grade level  preschool. I love it  it's the age group I was made to teach  and I feel completely comfortable at work. I am known for being a very chill/ relaxed teacher  fun coworker  and I always get positive feedback from administrators and parents alike. I am so comfortable teaching preschool that you could throw me in an empty room with twenty 3 to 5 year olds I've never met  no learning materials available  and I feel confident that I could keep things in order and entertain them for a few hours  no problem. So even with that kind of confidence  for whatever reason  I cannot  for the life of me  get a wink of sleep before my first day after a break. It's not a huge deal. I'm not really looking for a solution here  just venting and wanting to see if anyone else out there is in the same boat because misery loves company.  &#x200B;  When I first started teaching  I would often get stressed out by the usual BS all teachers deal with  unfair pay  angry parents  crazy e-mails  unfair policies  peer pressure from fellow teachers  not being taken seriously because ""it's just preschool""  the usual  but after about 5 years  I figured out how to keep my stress to a minimum and not take work home with me.

Under no circumstances should you *ever* be alone with this man  for academic help or otherwise. He is trying to lower your self esteem and convince you to go to his office hours to be alone with him. He's not only preying on you  but being wildly insulting--an 89 in a physics course is not a poor grade at all  especially for a non-Physics major. I've had to teach gen ed classes before; C's are common for my non-major students. You're doing well; if you feel you're struggling with unfamiliar material  take a look at the Feynman lectures or do some Khan Academy practice.   This should be brought directly to the dean  the department chair (especially this; they have more power than you think)  and the Ombuds Office at your university ASAP. Insisting a student with a high B come to office hours or help sessions is a red flag  as is trying to goad you into thinking you need it. Tell them everything you told us  and make it clear that he is specifically singling you out and does not do this to his male students. This is predatory behavior and should not be let go. If they try to brush you off  let your counselors and advisors know. This is a situation where you should not hesitate to cause conflict; if you don't  he may continue this pattern with other students.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.059516806722689074,31248,

Instead check out your grades and gradebook  screenshot everything  and make sure scores line up with the assignments you've had  tests you've taken  etc. If you still have your assignments from this session  keep them.  He may manipulate your grade as a means of getting you to ""come in and discuss"" things.     If you can  use a recording app on your phone or other device and record him when he approaches you during a lab. Different states have different rules about recording someone  so you might want to double check about that.      Take any and all evidence you have (recorded conversations  any emails or witnesses) and go to the department chair.

You have to ask yourself what you want to happen  and first think in terms of things that the administration can directly do to remedy your problem.  Do you want to be moved into a different class if possible?  Do you want a refund?  These are things the administration can directly cause to happen.  If you want the professor to change his behavior  the University can't make that happen as easily.  I wish it was different but it isn't.    As someone who represents higher education institutions for a living  I can tell you none of the advice here is not great.  They all believe you should report it because then the University will fix the problem/punish the professor.  They likely can't do much more than give him a reprimand for this conduct  and if he is simply reprimanded don't expect him to be any nicer to you.  He may make sure you are graded more harshly.    You could certainly go to the administration with this complaint  and the professor would likely know who singled him out even if you weren't named  based on the alleged conduct.  If that happens  I'm not sure you could rely on any type of help from the professor  and the professor will likely stop his current behavior  and be a little more sneaky  maybe just ignore you entirely.  However  this isn't the type of behavior that raises a big red flag where admin will certainly get involved.  In reality  there is likely little the University is interested in doing. As far as the administration is concerned  depending on the professor's status any type of discipline may involve hearings  and could involve a law suit by the professor if the professor is disciplined.  This isn't something admin wants to deal with.  Hopefully admin can talk to this guy and make him change but don't bet on it.

He's singling you out  as a woman  because he wants to engage in some kind of sexual relationship with you and the only way he can do that is if he lures you into his office and breaks your spirits. You are not overreacting. I was sexually harassed by an instructor last semester and he was fired. Don't be afraid to speak up  it can make a difference!  From now on  record all of your class sessions with him. Get audio recordings of him harassing you. If he ever asks you to stay after class  record anything and everything he says with your phone. Back up recordings on your computer and a flash drive. Keep digital and print copies of all emails he sends you. Keep detailed logs of the days he harasses you  what he says  and how often he demands you see him after class. Then  take all of this to the dean. I would also write down in as much detail as possible everything that has happened up until this point.    Sending an email to the department dean and ombudsman is a good idea.

Your professor’s behavior is beyond despicable. I majored in physics as an undergrad (I’m also female) and from my personal experience  gender discrimination is common in physics. My experiences were no where near as blatant as yours  but it IS a thing. In your case  the fact that your professor keeps asking you to stay after is even more troublesome. That makes it sound like his derogatory comments are meant to lower your self esteem enough in order to manipulate you into feeling like you owe him something in your private meetings. Gross.   I know you probably need to finish this course  you’ve paid for it  can’t afford to retake it and lose the time you’ve already put into it  etc. so reporting him might seem like a difficult option. Before you take it to that level  perhaps try writing him an email along the lines of “I appreciate your concern for my success  but your direct comments to me during class make it even more difficult for me to focus. I’m unable to come to your office hours as regularly as 3 times a week as you suggested  but I will make sure to attend if I have questions that I can’t figure out on my own.” Hopefully this allows you to push back a little without antagonizing him AND it creates a digital paper trail.

First of all  you dont deserve being spoken to that way. At all.  You know this but i want to highlight this.  This is an adult belittling another adult.  Secondly  you dont deserve to be compared to other students  for a multitude of reasons.  It sounds like he is ignorant AF.  Third  you sound like a great student  amd i am proud of u for holding these boundaries.  I think gender clearly plays a role here  and many women in your position would second guess themselves.  This professor sounds like they are trying to lower ur self esteem and get alone w u.  Its creepy as all get out.  I dont think u r the first person he has done this to.  I like the above idea of speaking w a counselor.  If u are close w another professor  i would also confide in them.  The main thing u will want to determine is whether u want to advance this (which i fully support bc f*** him) before or after final grades are submitted.

Being nervous and uncomfortable doesn’t always create the outward appearance of standing your ground. 2) He’s intentionally trying to get her alone  it seems. This is just not ok. He seems predatory and dominating and I would never recommend any young person to place themselves in this situation.

I'm kind of surprised you got that to work in middle school.  I have been teaching seniors for a number of years. I would advise you against using that method with high school students..even freshmen and sophomores.   I make my focus on building relationships with my kids. I did that in middle school too back when I taught at that level. While I have a seat chart  that's not my focus as a teacher. The first day of school like many other teachers  I do go over a course overview and basic norms I expect to see. But I chat with my kids much as I do here on Reddit.. as one adult to another. I treat them as young adults. Yes  I want them to give me a heads-up when they want to go to the restroom..then I usually nod at them and take the pass. I don't make basic things and basic needs a big deal. And if I see something that concerns me  I ask the student to step outside with me and I share with them what I'm concerned about and have a conversation. I always ask them how they're doing and if everything is copacetic in school/ at home  etc. It's part of building rapport.   Sorry for the ramble. But I would seriously think about focusing on relationships with the kids. You will likely have a better time with them and less real problems. This worked for me even with middle school students.

A week ago I completed a final round interview for a full-day Kindergarten position. I thought it went VERY well - the two other teachers and I clicked  and the conversation flowed. I was told I would hear back by the end of last week  but I haven’t. This means that I did not get that position  correct?   On Wednesday  I had a final round interview for my dream job. Third grade on a large team  the school has 1-1 devices  brand new math curriculum  school is beautiful  and it’s relatively close to my house.   I was going to be out of town for both the first round and second round interviews  so the principal and AP accommodated my first round interview and it went GREAT. I was invited to the final round  top 3 candidates. The principal set up a conference call for my final round so the teachers would not have to give up another summer day. #respect  I also think this interview went GREAT. I feel like I was at a disadvantage because I didn’t get to meet them face to face to show how passionate about this position I am  but I tried to convey it as much as possible through the phone. I made some personal connections with the team  and by the end we were laughing and joking around on the conference call. I was told I would hear from an HR person around this Wednesday.

Also  and this is another really crucial point  I don’t let them advance to the next unit until they’ve passed the test. If that means they’re stuck doing the one thing over and over for the entire year so be it. But typically  once students adjust to the policy they only really need one maybe two chances.

For me  this boils down to the question “What is  your goal/reason for giving the test?”  Some kiddos just don’t do well on tests. It’s a fact. I  myself suck at timed exams which involve writing. Other people have testing anxiety (even at a young age). Still more are able to demonstrate skills in less formal settings  but cant when given pen and paper. And this doesn’t even take into account the idiosyncrasies of creating assessments and assessment rubrics (and the many prevailing failings that these often have).   I work with young children (elementary aged) where my grades are supposed to be indicative of a student’s ability to demonstrate a given skill  as laid out by our state standards. For example  in kindergarten (that’s the report card template I happen to have handy) it specifies things like “identifies 52 letters” “correctly names 2D and 3D shapes” or “states the city  state  and country in which the student lives.” I don’t care where  when or how they demonstrate these skills so much as if they CAN they demonstrate them. I do give formal assessments  but  if I notice that a student isn’t performing  I check my informal data  reteach  and reassess. My grades are a combination of these two factors.   This mentality rolls over when I am working with higher grades (4th/5th) too. I do allow my kiddos to have one retake on any given test. This “retake” comes in two different forms. One  they take their test and correct their mistakes writing me a short (typically no more than a few sentences) reason for WHY their original answer was wrong.

Something always changes or there is a better idea  or more likely the district requirements change.  &#x200B;  The district has been moving toward a standards based grading and student self progression (meaning students can sort of work at their own pace but still have dates for tests and finals). I personally believe there is nothing wrong with retaking a test. If it were just my decision I would offer unlimited retakes  just with strict requirements.  1. Students must have all work completed. If you haven't been doing your work then you only get the one try. 2. Students must prove to me (and this is really subjective) that they have mastered their mistakes and are ready to try and prove it on an assessment. This is usually corrections as well as a little sit down so the student can verbally explain their thought process to me. 3. The highest score on a retake is a 90%.

Fixing that is more important than making mistakes in class. If your students want to watch you fail  things are't good.   &#x200B;  I don't know how to solve that. I will say for next year you need to think about yourself as a teacher a little differently so that this doesn't rattle you so much. I would start by embracing the fact that while you are an authority in your field that doesn't mean you know EVERYTHING. Recenter yourself and think of yourself more as an authority in your field  which includes the field of teaching. So you're not (for ex) a mathematician by profession but you're damn good at teaching kids math. You'll look up something you don't know  or you'll look up a better way of doing it but it allows you to be human from time to time.      That has worked for me. I know I don't know everything about history and I wouldn't classify myself as a historian. However  I'm pretty damn knowledgeable and I'm good at teaching kids about historical events AND how to ""do history"".

But the students just laughed and said they understood because they've made big timeline mistakes too. I often will get questions and I'll say that I straight up don't know the answer  why don't they google it.   &#x200B;  Also  so what about you being 24?

What would make it possible  for new teachers to flourish and become qualified teachers?  Smaller class sizes.  Behavior interventions.  Counseling for my kids where they would have a chance to deal with the crap in their lives instead of taking it out on themselves and those around them.  Support for teachers.  Support for families.     My district has crazy turnover and a hard time retaining teachers despite paying more than most of  the surrounding districts.

When I applied I knew I would make less at this school than I could in the public schools but even though the smaller pay can be challenging at times  there are several perks. I’m lucky where the student behavior at my school isn’t really an issue (pretty well behaved and respectful students overall) which is definitely a perk after some of the experiences I had in surrounding public schools. The class sizes at mine are also smaller which I feel very fortunate about. I am also able to get some student loan forgiveness after so many years of teaching there as well which is a nice little perk.   Every school is different. I accepted my job with the low salary but I love my school. However  to answer your question  in general I think all teachers need a bit of a raise for what we do.

In Henderson  I had an astounding 54 students in two of my largest classes. My largest class at my current school had just 24 students!  The year I transferred  the school got a new principal. She brought in a new administrative team as well as several experienced teachers like myself. The first thing she did was to clean house. Drug dealers and gang members were either arrested by Metro or were eventually expelled. Teachers with bad attitudes (verbal/emotional abuse of students  indifference to teaching etc.) were encouraged to leave. She started a food bank for students. She eliminated the stigma of a free or reduced lunch by offering a free breakfast and lunch to all students. She started a clothing bank. She hired a social worker to help connect families in need to private  municipal  county  state  and Federal programs to assist with job training  employment  transportation  health care  food needs  and housing.   The $10 000 stipend is nice but having a reasonable class size  being supported with class management  and having a positive school climate are even more important. Although my school is a Title 1 facility  it's a really nice place to work.  In terms of having lost our dean  the principal was able to produce a new AP position.

369,Fysics_is_Phun,Looking for any tips or advice with Cyber School Teaching and interviewing for a position.,"Hey all. I've got an interview with a Cyber School soon  and until now since student teaching about 2 years ago  I've just been subbing. I'll be interviewing for a High school teaching position within this cyber school and was hoping that some of you might have any advice on what to expect or tips on what to touch on in my answers. My first concern is if I should be dressed in a suit and tie or something less formal than that? It'll also be my first time interviewing for a teacher position other than the subbing ""interview"" which didn't really feel like an interview.   Thanks for any help anyone can offer!",self,No video,2019-07-16 06:53:49,1.0,2.0,0.0,brapo68,"WOW I just got hired as a cyber teacher. I can help.  Come in dressed to impress always . Its better to be over dressed than to look like you don't care.   Second be ready to talk tech   and parent contact. What I knew about the ""Subject""  wasn't important. Using things like Google Voice   a translator  and not being afraid to call parents was very important.   Know their programs name when you walk in   and know the basics of it.

371,MysteriousPlatypus,What is the wildest thing that’s happened to you in your time as a teacher?,I’m talking about the most ridiculous  absurd  outrageous story  interaction with a parent  admin  student  etc. that you’ll probably never forget as long as you live  whether good or bad.  I’m a 4th year teacher but so far  my craziest thing has to be when a student claimed she was raped in my classroom.   Two years ago I had just started at a new school  teaching a 7th grade homeroom. I had a student in my class  H  who I had been told had a history of self-harm  attempted suicide  and had been in and out of hospitals multiple times due to this. Evidently the year before she was found with razors in the girls bathroom trying to kill herself  so she was not allowed to use the bathroom alone. Admin was just trying to give me a heads up and some tips on how to best connect with this girl.   The second week of school I get called down to the office after school. My principal was sitting across from a police officer. Evidently H had gone home that day and told her mother she was raped in front of the lockers by another student  J. She claimed this happened during morning announcements when myself and 23 other students were in the room  with the lockers in full view of all of us  and that she was screaming for help and nobody did anything. The mother had then called the police.  My principal took my side and knew that this was obviously 100% not true  but I still had to talk to the police and give a statement. The next day we heard that H had been hospitalized after she once again attempted suicide at home. When her psychiatrist spoke with her regarding the incident from school  H changed her story and said it never happened and that she made up the whole thing because “she thought it would be funny.” I kid you not. While I hate that she accused me of deliberately not stopping a rape  I knew that she really had some serious problems and just needed help.  The case was then closed  and the girl’s mother withdrew her from the school. I saw her a few months back while out shopping and we chatted for a few moments. After leaving our school she went to another school but had been kicked out of there for some reason  and was now in a 3rd school. I only knew her for about 2 weeks. I hope she got the help she needed  but I still worry about her. And I’ll never  ever forget the fear I felt when I had to speak to the police. Despite the fact that the story was bonkers  when you’re under that kind of stress you can’t help but think “what if by some chance  something really did happen and I somehow didn’t see it?” You doubt yourself  and I was afraid for my career. Thankfully it’s all in the past and my principal supported me  but the whole thing was nuts.  So anyway  what is your most insane story?,self,No video,2019-07-16 09:31:17,0.0,1.0,0.0,,,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.0,31461,0.378

What I remember most is “out of the box” time where we could work anywhere in the classroom EXCEPT at a desk. Some people sat on floor pillows. Some sat in the caste (to be honest  it became the “property” of the queen bee clique until the teacher put an end to that). Some sat on top of the desk. Some sat at HER desk. Some even sat in the hallway outside. One brave soul hopped out the window (first floor room) and sat in the grass outside. It was great.

Their boss battles are a little weak for my taste  but you can do a lot with just a leaderboard  ways for them to earn gold or xp with side quests or changing assignment names to heroic quest  elite quest  or boss battles. Leaderboard can have their id number or screen tag  you only show a tab for their total grade earned plus any bonuses you give out. I also track their gold they can spend at my item shop for made up stuff that are free.   My review games are popular bad guys who have a certain health. I work through the review slides like old school jeopardy and instead of earned pts  they roll dice to deal damage to the boss. If they miss  the boss attacks the class’ hp. Person who answers is random so they have have to record their answer and then hold it up if they get called on. If you have a class currency system you can create item cards to boost their rolls or reduce boss damage. My kids love it and my admin doesn’t understand it at all. I have gotten only good reviews from observations when they came during a battle only because the kids are enthusiastic about learning/reviewing even if admin doesn’t get it.  It does take a lot of extra work to setup and later updating takes less time but still more than most are willing to do. If you want something simpler and premade  classcraft should be your go-to.  The website **Deck.toys** is also kind of cool for chaining together assignments or doing a digital breakout. They take some time to create though and are better for lower level skilled review like vocabulary or classifying things into categories.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.1883377425044092,31498,

I am actually currently doing this exact thing with my 9th grade English class :)  Some background:  I'm a big nerd who runs a Magic the Gathering Club and a D&D club at my school and DM my own weekly group. I've been playing videogames since the original NES  and now try to blend all my interests into teaching and leading workshops and PD for my county on how to increase student engagement.   I see several people in the tread mentioned Classcraft  I'm actually also an ambassador for Classcraft (I use it in my class and work directly with their development team to offer feedback and beta test new features) and can answer any questions you might have and give advice if you are interested in incorporating that into the class. It's very cool and can add a lot if you're ready to commit. It does have a lot of front load work  and can be distracting if it's not implemented in a careful way. Definitly something you would wanna set up before the start of the year and not something to dive into in the middle of the semester.  Other stuff that you might be interested in:  1. Item Cards: I use Mtgcardsmith.com to make custom Magic the Gathering style cards. These cards represent abilities or items that students can unlock and use in class. I even have booster packs I made to key into the same addicting pleasure centers as loot boxes in videogames (students just don't have to pay money and gamble on mine haha).  2. Gamification: gamification is the idea of putting game-like elements into non-game things (I assume a lot of you are familiar with this concept especially if you're wanting to incorporate RPG stuff into your class). There are several really cool things about this concept you can find online that you can steal and adapt into your class. I'm actually also a mod on the gamification subreddit. It's a bit small and focuses more on gamification in a professional or business setting  but every so often something good for education gets posted.  The YouTube channel ""Extra Credit"" also has a really awesome playlist on gamification in education that discusses some more big picture concepts.  ""Explore Like a Pirate"" is an AMAZING book with lots of cool ideas that can easily be incorporated into a fantasy style classroom.  I do lots of review games that I got or modeled from that book. Or  just play several board games and see what mechanics you can steal and tweak for your own uses.  3. Dice and Randomness: Dice are your friend. I love trying to incorporate randomness into a lesson or activity when I can. You can even get specialized dice (I have a 30 sided one that has each letter of the alphabet and 4 wild sides I use in writing exercises). Students  honestly everyone really  love rolling dice.  4. Theme Consistancy: try to make sure that you're as consistent as can be when it comes to your theme. Anywhere you can incorporate the RPG theme  do it. For example  my grade system is modeled after an XP bar where everyone starts at zero and ""level up"" as they complete quests (assignments) instead of the tradition system where all the assignments are averaged together. Another way I try to reinforce my the.e is with my syllabus. I modeled it after the game guides that used to come in the box when you bought a physical game disc. Several of my assignments are also written as part of an overall story where the students are returning to save a kingdom that has fallen into chaos.  Sorry for the super long post haha :) this stuff is my jam! I'd love to discuss it more with anyone who's interested.",,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.2122262952101661,31499,

I think I still have a copy of the syllabus and spell manual if any of you want to see it! At the beginning of the semester you made a character with a name  a tool (sword/shield/magic were the choices I think) and chose a pathway/skill that had a secret ability that could be unlocked by means only known to the professor.  The different types of assignments counted as different game elements. Pop quizzes were random monster encounters  midterm/final were bosses  etc. General attendance was counted by finding ""loot"" during lectures that you wrote at the bottom of the next quiz/test/in-class assignment. You earned XP and MP from doing assignments/attendance to level up which was displayed in an anonymous graph each week for a competitive leaderboard and to show you how well you were doing compared to others to see if you were doing well or falling behind. Your total XP was calculated over to a letter grade at the end of the semester.  He created a spell manual that you could use on assignments and tests and costed MP. There were spells that boosted homework points  boosted your scores and the scores of a friend or other classmate  test question skips  etc.   He really went all in on it and even had the sound effects from various games and animated sprites for monsters/treasure chests in his power points. I absolutely loved his class and it really broke a lot of students out of their shells.

Students can get experience for whatever reason you want.  They can also take damage for classroom infractions.  Class abilities let them take damage for someone else  get a few minutes of free time.  It's customizable  so it's up to your or the students imagination.  They get armor upgrades  pets  quests.

Most importantly  what kind of a classroom environment do you want to create? What are you willing to do to create this environment (make sure you back up your opinions with some recent research  also emphasize that you have the knowledge&education  even if you have no experience yet). Once you have a solid opinion about these and a clear plan on how to execute them  the interview should be smooth sailing. Another thing is  you need to explain how your statements align with the institution's vision (this is usually where you make it or break it). It is also essential to show willingness for professional improvement; you can mention your plans to earn continuing education credits  attend seminars & trainings  etc. Hope this helps  best of luck!,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.28,31539,0.085

451,halfwittnerfherder,First Job is causing mixed emotions,Right before graduation  I sent my application to 6 different districts. My dream district had about 13 positions open and 2 positions at the schools that I student taught. I never received any interest from this district despite attending the schools  volunteering  and student teaching there. It has been a tough rejection to process.  However  I interviewed at the next town over and received an offer for a 6th grade position. I accepted because it was my first offer and I was excited about the small class sizes and involved community.   However  after learning details of the position  I am worried. The salary is only 34 000. Approximately 6 000 less than the other district. The benefits are not great. It has no coverage until the 6 000 deductible is met. With a chronically ill child (asthma)  I am worried.   I also need to pay for gas to drive there and $100 a week for daycare for my son. I feel that after all of these expenses  I am working for basically nothing and am in no better position than I currently am.   I am so conflicted because my dream has been to teach but it is a hard pill to swallow that the job is what it is.

I often see it when looking at jobs in higher paying cities. I would get more per month but the first year of that increase would go to paying off my moving expenses and if the cost of living in that city is higher I may end up with effectively the same pay and the cost of moving would be a loss. You are seeing an extreme version of that scenario  this position may cover (just barely) some people's cost of living  but not yours.

Honestly I think that if you are looking for a foundational knowledge of teaching  the MAT is the way to go. MEd from what I understand is much more focused (ie - reading specialists  etc) on a specific facet of teaching and at my school was only offered to graduate students who already had an education degree and were already certified.   I cannot speak to how districts/schools look at the different types of masters programs.

MEd is your masters after you have your BEd. It’s more specific to which direction you’re headed  say for example teaching adults  focusing on ELL  Special Education  etc. Many MEds are flexible as well  offering course based or thesis/research based. I feel like this takes longer because you first have to get your BEd before you take your MEd...at least many schools require this. Depending on your program  you will have practicum  but not as much as MT. MT is a combo of your teacher’s qualification along with a masters in it. It’s condensed into about two years - so imagine taking a BEd with it’s homework  teaching practicum  and theory based education all in one  and at the end of it  you get two degrees. You’ll have to do extra research when you’re looking at schools as well because there have been some recent changes that require MT to do additional qualification courses (some ministry of education new rule). I don’t know which area you are from  but this happened in Ontario (at U of T) - you can imagine how many MT’s were upset.   I hope my information helps!!!

Be respectful with your cooperating teacher and talk up front with him or her about any issues. Involve supervisor or coordinator if needed. Learn what you can and can't do as a student teacher.

I whole heartedly agree with the above two comments. Don’t put so much pressure on yourself  dialoguing with a Mentor Teacher and/or Field Supervisor (contingent upon your program and school culture)  as well as getting to know your students. All students will attempt to show you some sort of affection  it is okay for you to say you don’t want to be touch. I’ve worked in a trauma based setting for years and many students were touch averse  there are many ways to show appreciation for another that is it touch; thus  ask your host/mentor teacher and or supervisor. There could be protocol in the classroom you student teach and/or ethical guidelines surrounding student intern and student relations.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.2222222222222222,31550,

All of the above comments are great advice. My input would be to connect well with the host teacher first and foremost. Your host teacher will probably have lots of strong advice for you going into your student teaching. On top of that obviously try your best to make strong connections with your students.  As a fellow male teacher I was also terrified of the whole “hugging” issue. I feel as though it depends on the school. That’s something you would want to talk to your host teacher about. Personally I always gave hugs to the ones who wanted them. I also did a lot of hand holding in the hallways and high fives for good work. My rule with the hugs would be  if allowed  try your best to one arm hug your students. They are REALLY tiny  so it’ll probably be easier to do that anyway. The whole one arm hug will save you from any accusations assuming the worst while also allowing you to connect with your students.   I was a terrified going into my semester. I had always been fond of the older elementary grades. Let me tell you that I absolutely left that classroom devastated. It was such an amazing experience overall. I am still a firm believer that it is not for everyone  but if you go into it with a positive attitude I know you’ll do just fine. Employers really do like to see Kindergarten experience on a resume  especially as a male. This will be such an unique experience for you but it will be worth it all in the end!,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.2230397727272728,31553,

Supposedly we generally have the ability to actively remember 150-200 names or about the size of a decent village. According to the theory I heard  we generally can't retain more than this because for a huge chuck of Human existence  we never needed to. So once you don't have regular contact with students (in this case) your brain basically files it away as no longer actively needed.  &#x200B;  This is supposedly why people are good at remembering faces but not names. Partly because faces are visual and this easier to remember due to their unique nature and partly because generally you only hear someone's name once or twice and are expected to remember it.  &#x200B;  I spent 2 years at my last school. Still don't know the names of some of my kids and I had them for both years. I know their faces  I know their work  I know their hobbies.

553,leeshis0019,Grading Codes?,"I'm curious if anyone has any ""codes"" they employ when grading student work?  I have a set of my own  but am always looking to expand on it. I **always** find myself writing out longer comments and then I get pissy with myself.  &#x200B;  I'll always use a different color than the kids (usually red or purple). Since I teach science I usually end up grading math work or conclusions on labs. Or the entire lab (data collection  etc.). So I'll write things like ""sf"" for ""significant figures"" \[being wrong\] or ""ics"" for ""incomplete sentence"". Basically  if I found myself writing things out a lot I just shortened it.  &#x200B;  The kids get a paper from me at the beginning of the year with the code.

Usually it's things like a lack of argumentation or not connecting all the parts of an answer. I used to write stuff like 'and?' or 'why?' and I thought this would help clear up why I thought their answer was wrong.  Recently I had to hand in something myself at uni for a course I'm taking and the professor had written some comments in the word document. They were the same style; 'why?'  'and?'  'so?' - and the negativity of it all was just overwhelming. It really didn't help me at all and just made my lose my confidence in what I'd written  even though it was pretty good.  So since then I've started to write more positive feedback  and to elaborate on negative feedback with suggestions. For example writing stuff like 'when comparing  describe A first  then B  then point out differences/similarities  you can do it!'.

I do independent loose rotations and literature circles currently with upper elementary. I base my rotations somewhat around Daily 5 as the choice and ease of activities is pretty straightforward. I haven't done the PD but borrowed the book from the library. I really enjoy literature circles too  it has made my class much more engaged readers.  I think small group rotations is definitely harder than whole class teaching. Some approaches to it are purposefully busywork for this reason  you just value the 20 minutes with each group enough to be happy that the kids are quiet and (somewhat) productive during that time. My class this year are very engaged learners so it is easier for me now than it has been. It also helps to use tech for a couple of rotations if you have it - kidnews  epic  etc.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.09989878542510122,31668,0.112

I feel like this last year I was always experimenting with my centers and never quite seemed to figure out the best flow for my students. I have read about the Daily 5 and have many ideas saved on Pinterest for that (I think other teachers in my school do something similar) so I may try that this year. I like the literature circles idea as well. I teach 2nd grade and could tailor it to that age and level. Do you use level readers for this or books (like a book club)?   I agree. It’s a challenge with 2nd graders because they tend to have a lot of questions which interrupts my small group time so I need to incorporate some “ask 3 before me” procedure to cut down on that. I also felt like I was often just looking for busy work to keep them occupied while I tried to focus on small groups. We do have tablets in our room with RAZ Kids and Epic (which they love!) so we use those quite often. I’ll look for some more engaging apps to add for that too.

Over the summer  I have been working with him at least 5 days a week about 30 minutes or more each time.  I have a summer 1st to 2nd grade workbook  a 1st grade reading workbook and 1st grade sight words.  He does okay  but only with my help.  He can read quite a bit of the stories but gets stuck quite often on certain words.  He can answer  correctly  the comprehension questions after the reading but it is a struggle to get through the readings.  He enjoys the math in the workbook and does great with those.  Any tips to help him with reading and learning the sight words better.  Out of 200 words there about 50 he consistently struggles with.  Like mixing up first and fast  even though I remind him about the r sound in first that is not in fast.  That’s just one example.  We read together regularly and he loves reading before bed  so this isn’t an example of never reading growing up.    I know that students that struggle in reading continue to struggle throughout their school careers (I witness it every day in the high school).  That is why I work with him so much. Most days he is excited to do his “school work” but at other times I feel so helpless trying to help him.  At times we are both frustrated  impatient and I feel I am giving him anxiety trying to teach him.

Sometimes creating sentences has helped my students as well because they associate the sight word with a sentence.

Explain that when you get frustrated  it is not with him. Explain that you get frustrated because you love him and you want him to succeed  and so you feel with him as he struggles.  Listen to how he feels when he's frustrated (use questions that start with ""what"" - they have more open answers).  Might be worth getting a) an eye exam (seriously  this can make reading so difficult if you cannot see!) and b) a psyc ed evalution to see if anything is up in terms of particular challenges or information processing difficulties.  Try slow reading - it     is      rea   ding     but      it     is    muuchh      slooo  werr.  If you've noticed he's rather sharp in some areas  his brain might be getting ahead of his mouth.

He can answer  correctly  the comprehension questions after the reading but it is a struggle to get through the readings.  He enjoys the math in the workbook and does great with those.  Any tips to help him with reading and learning the sight words better.  Out of 200 words there about 50 he consistently struggles with.  Like mixing up first and fast  even though I remind him about the r sound in first that is not in fast.  That’s just one example.  We read together regularly and he loves reading before bed  so this isn’t an example of never reading growing up.    I know that students that struggle in reading continue to struggle throughout their school careers (I witness it every day in the high school).  That is why I work with him so much. Most days he is excited to do his “school work” but at other times I feel so helpless trying to help him.  At times we are both frustrated  impatient and I feel I am giving him anxiety trying to teach him.    I would really like him to at least be at a 1st grade level when he starts second grade and hope to get him to a 2nd grade level by the end of the year  so he is finally caught up.

If you’re able to  a good tutor with a more specific area of expertise should be able to pinpoint the issue  and should be able to scaffold his learning appropriately/give you some more specific guidance until the school year restarts.  Have his prior teachers given you any guidance as to what he appears to be struggling with specifically?  Some general advice is to make sure you’re keeping it fun! Make sure he’s got access to some high interest books  and take breaks when he feels frustrated. If sight words are your focus  gamify them as much as possible so that he doesn’t feel like they’re a chore.   If you’ve got a pet or any younger children in your life  have him read books to them: feeling like the “expert” can be a huge confidence booster and might give some extra motivation!,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.22425,31707,

Phonemic awareness is also a big part of learning to read. Put simply  phonemic awareness is the ability to hear and manipulate sounds in words. It can be really hard for struggling readers to get the sounds together in the right order to make words. PA is done with out any print materials so it's easy to do in the car or while waiting for things in public.  Play rhyming games and change one sound games to make new words. For example: start with fit. Change the /f/ to /k/  what's the new word? Kit. Change /i/ to /a/. What's the new word? Cat. Change /t/ to /p/. What's the new word? Cap. Add /l/ after /c/  what's the word  now? Clap. Change the ending to /aw/. Claw. Change cl to p  paw. In these games  say the sounds  not the letter names. Most kiddos love these games and will have fun trying to puzzle out the new words. They are low stress and can be really funny if you make the right combination of words. Fart  butt  and the like can really keep young boys attention and make you laugh too. Don't be afraid to get into nonsense words too. Have fun with it and keep working!   And great job so far!

Practice these until mastery. Practice 5 words a day they don’t know by writing them 5 x each and use them in a sentence.  Focus on decoding ( long and short vowels  silent e  vowel pairs  etc) and teach these rules as they practice their sight words. Also reading fluency  2nd grade should read a minimum of 87 words correct in 1 min. Practice read a passage with them a few times and then let them read as quickly as they can without making many mistakes. If they miss a word  help them decode it. Then have them read 2x with the timer  beating their time each read is the goal. They should miss no more then 5 words at their grade level  if the reading is to hard have them practice 1st grade. Reading goals are as follows: 1st 47 words  2nd 87  3rd 100  4th 115  5th 130  6th 120  all in 1 min with no more then 5 mistakes.

Were all his milestones with talking and moving normal? Does he speak clearly? If you go a diagnosis route - research and go to the peak dyslexia org you can find for their suggestions. As with everything  there are real snake oil sellers out there.  Ask his school what their approach to reading instruction is and what interventions are in place for struggling readers. If they have no synthetic phonics instruction (which may be case if they have emphasised sight words) you could consider using that at home?  The school needs to teach your kid to read  really. Keep on their ass about it. I would expect some specialised instruction/intervention for a child this behind.  In the meantime  take him to the library or bookshop as often as you can  get the books he likes the look of and your childhood favourites and enjoy them together. He is hitting the age where learning problems can really start to affect self esteem and it's important you can keep reading and learning fun for me.

You need to be able to hear and manipulate parts of words in order to use phonic knowledge to decode. This will alert you to any gaps in this ability you need to address before you march on. Make sure the foundation is strong.   Then start a systematic phonics program which includes reading and writing. Get decodable readers. He sounds like he'll fly through the consonants but the routine and success will set him up well for the vowel digraphs he finds challenging. Check out cued articulation  it might help ... I find my strugglers can often recall a sound from my cue better than from reading it and it's a helpful scaffold so I'm not just telling them.  Same with sight words  he needs to be reading and writing them. Really short ""guided writing"" sentences at this stage is fine! We pick two phonetically irregular words (put  some) or with more advanced phonics rules (like  read) each week.  Write a little 4 line book with those wprds with him  read it all week  have him write similar sentences with and without assistance. A mini whiteboard is very engaging for this task.  Lastly  play around with covering words and pictures with post it notes to make him rely on context from the sentence structure  the text meaning and the pictures. You'll be saying stuff like : what word could this be  what letter will we see  what makes sense  what do we know or expect?",,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.3437037037037037,31717,

639,bashful-y-sappy,How best to teach reading to 7 year old?,I teach high school math  but I struggle with helping my own children in reading.  My 7 year old is about to go to 2nd grade  but is a struggling reader.  He finished first grade at a preprimer level (tho better than he started).  Over the summer  I have been working with him at least 5 days a week about 30 minutes or more each time.  I have a summer 1st to 2nd grade workbook  a 1st grade reading workbook and 1st grade sight words.  He does okay  but only with my help.  He can read quite a bit of the stories but gets stuck quite often on certain words.  He can answer  correctly  the comprehension questions after the reading but it is a struggle to get through the readings.  He enjoys the math in the workbook and does great with those.  Any tips to help him with reading and learning the sight words better.  Out of 200 words there about 50 he consistently struggles with.  Like mixing up first and fast  even though I remind him about the r sound in first that is not in fast.  That’s just one example.  We read together regularly and he loves reading before bed  so this isn’t an example of never reading growing up.    I know that students that struggle in reading continue to struggle throughout their school careers (I witness it every day in the high school).  That is why I work with him so much. Most days he is excited to do his “school work” but at other times I feel so helpless trying to help him.  At times we are both frustrated  impatient and I feel I am giving him anxiety trying to teach him.    I would really like him to at least be at a 1st grade level when he starts second grade and hope to get him to a 2nd grade level by the end of the year  so he is finally caught up.

Preemptively forgive yourself for screwing it up because you will and realize that  like all skills  it comes with practice.   In terms of your own personal story  tell them whatever is easily googleable. If they can’t find it without some searching they probably won’t. In which case keep it professional. Feel free to use the line “now isn’t a good time. We’re getting distracted from _____________. Let’s get back to work.  If you’re really interested we can talk about it after class”  Teens are weird. They’re very curious. They’ll ask about your personal/political/religious beliefs  your family  your significant other. But they’re very superficially curious. They don’t really need your story and to be frank  they don’t even want it. They’re mostly concerned with themselves and their romantic interests. They want to know about their future. And from you they need stability. There are few enough “good” adults in the world you have to be one. Which means not getting angry or yelling or losing your temper. But it also means setting limits. And being consistent. Teens need to be able to see you channel your emotions in a healthy productive way. And how do you manage all that? You practice. How do you know where your limits are? Because someone at some point will cross one and you’ll have to do something and then you’ll know where your limit is.   Honestly it’s like everything else. Be honest. Be authentic. Be patient.

An organic reason will come up  or it won’t and then you don’t have to talk about it. If you’re dropping in into a one on one conversation  expect that the whole school will know in about a week.   Otherwise  set some hard limits on things you feel comfortable talking about and not.

I also liked what they said about Googleable info  because that aspect definitely didn’t occur to me.  I think on a day-to-day basis  be yourself without sharing your life story. If you’re into sports or games or a show  definitely feel free to bring that up during a moment of free time or as relevant to an example you are giving  because that helps them see you as a human being capable of having fun and understanding what it’s like to be stressed or not have enough time to spend on hobbies. Small talk is actually great and will likely be the bread and butter of keeping a general positive atmosphere in your classroom.  As for the really heavy stuff...keep that card in your pocket for a student you feel really needs to hear it. Don’t go around saying it to the whole class  but there might be one student who would find your story inspiring and needs that encouragement  and I think it’d be more special for that student if they were the only one to hear that about you. You know  controlled vulnerability. An equal exchange of trust.  Definitely be careful when you’re a student teacher. It’s not your classroom. You’re a huge part of it  yes  but in the end you’re sharing in your mentor’s space.

Thank you!,self,No video,2019-07-15 10:36:02,2.0,7.0,1.0,Nomed73,Sorry about everything you’ve been through.   I have done some mock lessons before. You have 20 minutes so I would go with what you have.  Here is a simple one that might work in Alg 1 that deals with y=Mx + b.   T: how many of you have had pizza before?   Let students answer  almost all students have had pizza.    T: which toppings do you guys usually get?  As they are listing the toppings make a mental note of how many different toppings are called out. (Suppose max number of toppings is 8)   T: what do you guys usually pay for a large cheese pizza   o toppings just a plain one?  When they say prices pick the most common one.  Let’s say for this example they say $11.   T: are the extra toppings free or do we have to pay?  As they say they cost extra get into a conversation as to how much they cost and find an agreeable price for each extra topping.  For this example I will use $1.50 per topping.    NOw comes the Algebra part to it.  I usually present what would a price board at a shop look like for customers so that they new how much it would cost.   So we start creating an xy chart with three columns. The first column is number of toppings  second one is left blank for now  and third one is labeled price.   So we start. (Not sure about formatting)  Toppings——blank column—-Price 0.                                                           11  T: okay so let’s say we get one topping on the pizza  how much would we pay?  (They will say $12.50. Quickly  fill second row of table with this info) that’s correct how did you get that? (Listen to the different ways and push them to say 11 for the cheese pizza and 1.50 for the extra topping. I usually play dumb. If they say 11+1.5 I ask where the 11 came from  why did they add  where did the 1.50 come from  etc. What ever method is more thorough write this down in the blank column. I write down 11 + 1(1.50) then move on to the next row for 2 toppings).  T: what if we ordered 2 different toppings?  (Repeat the same process above so they can explain how they are coming up with the answers.  Look for thw 11+1.50+1.50 and the 11+3  ask where they get three. Now I fill in the third row with 2  11 + 2(1.50)  14.  I don’t write down the second column after we know where all the numbers are coming from. )   After this I ask them to complete the table (up to the max number of toppings we agreed to earlier.).   Once it’s compete and we all agree on it  we move on to plotting the data. Toppings vs price.  Then we use the middle column to come up with the formula by looking for a pattern.  What changes and what stays the same in the middle column for every row.  The equation looks like this: price = original cost + 1.5(number of toppings).    We go through this example with lots of questions and conversations.  It’s a fun one that most students relate to and participate. And it also establishes a background we can always refer to in the future.  When kids are confused with more complex problems saying something like  this is the toppings and this is the cheese pizza helps them a bit.    Sorry for the long post.  If you need more details send a PM. Good luck tomorrow!!!!,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.06456500488758554,31742,

Y'all can't handle someone advising someone not to break the law because it's the law; you act like it's someone's opinion because you don't like it.  Boohoo.*  Genuine advice:  Just don't smoke it at all if you're a teacher (or want to become one).  Employers can refuse to hire you for any number of reasons -- even tobacco and alcohol use.  I know I'll be downvoted straight to hell for even suggesting that a teacher not use marijuana  but whatever.  What do you prioritize?  Teaching or pot use?  Because the reality is that  generally speaking  you can't have both  even in states where it's legal  because you're still breaking federal law.  Agree with that law or don't  but it's still the law right now -- and that's not my opinion; it's a *FACT*  so everybody chill with the downvotes and squalling.  That being said ... If you smoked once or twice and don't generally smoke at all  you're probably okay after a couple of weeks  though I'm not sure about the hair follicle thing or how long that stays there.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.21857142857142856,31763,

Most of my questions boil down to what file to put things in. I’m doing World Languages but my questions are general so anyone could answer!   1. So instructional materials vs. assessment materials....this is very vague in the handbook. Should I include the assessments in the instructional materials file as well  or only have them in the assessment materials file?  2. How many assessment materials should you have? I have one formal assessment which is a writing prompt. Anything else is informal “monitoring student work  asking questions  etc.” I have a few in class or homework worksheets that I collect  do those count as “assessments”? I’m just confused and I feel like I only have 1 real assessment. Also  should the assessment evaluation criteria (a rubric) go in the assessment materials file too or only in the “evaluation criteria” file for Task 3?  3. Do I need a lesson plan for my assessment?

I have 3 lesson plans which are actual lessons  and the 4th lesson plan is just for the day where students take the assessment  so there’s no actual teaching.

I believe you address all of that in your assessment commentary.

715,thesassydreamer,edTPA questions - Organization/format related,Hi! So I’m working on my edTPA right now and planning on submitting it in a few days. I have a few questions I was hoping people here could answer  because I’ve done so much searching and haven’t been able to figure it out. Everything is so unclear and confusing! Most of my questions boil down to what file to put things in. I’m doing World Languages but my questions are general so anyone could answer!   1. So instructional materials vs. assessment materials....this is very vague in the handbook. Should I include the assessments in the instructional materials file as well  or only have them in the assessment materials file?  2. How many assessment materials should you have? I have one formal assessment which is a writing prompt. Anything else is informal “monitoring student work  asking questions  etc.” I have a few in class or homework worksheets that I collect  do those count as “assessments”? I’m just confused and I feel like I only have 1 real assessment. Also  should the assessment evaluation criteria (a rubric) go in the assessment materials file too or only in the “evaluation criteria” file for Task 3?  3. Do I need a lesson plan for my assessment? This is the writing prompt assessment I am using for task 3 and have student work samples from. I have 3 lesson plans which are actual lessons  and the 4th lesson plan is just for the day where students take the assessment  so there’s no actual teaching. The LP basically just says “teacher explains instructions  students work on exam all class  teacher answers questions and collects at end”. I thought I needed an LP for that but now I’m thinking maybe I don’t  I can just list it as a “post-assessment” at the bottom of my LPs doc? Can someone clarify?  I think that’s all. Thank you so much anyone who can help  I appreciate it!,self,No video,2019-07-15 10:11:27,8.0,2.0,3.0,mrsavilar,1.  It depends on the task. For task 2 you need to include everything! 3. You only include the lessons for the lesson block that you wrote about in your planning commentary.  Even though these are general questions  each handbook is different and asks for different materials. There should be one page prior to each task that lists in detail what you need to include and in what format. I suggest submitting everything in pdf just so formatting does not change. Also bold all the vocabulary words you used (like the ones found on your rubrics). Include a rubric for your assessment and include graphs displaying everyone’s scores. Hope this helps!!,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.09513888888888887,31805,

I was in band from grades 6-12  and my (obviously biased) opinion is that a band director SHOULD have a big personality.

If you’re meek and mild  then how are you going to get students and parents to practice every day  internalize strict conduct expectations  and fundraise like hell?

For example  a teacher at my school applied at another school district with connections and didn’t get the job. When she asked for feedback  they said they didn’t want to hire her because they didn’t want to upset our current principal by taking her. If that was true  they wouldn’t have even given her an interview. If she was the best candidate  they would have selected her. Something similar happened with my sister in law who applied for a college job. She got an interview as an incoming freshman  didn’t get it  and was told it was because she was an incoming freshman. Excuse me  but you wouldn’t get an interview with an incoming freshman if you didn’t consider the possibility that an incoming freshman could do the job. In order to preserve feelings  interviewers often list something that is out of the interviewee’s control to soften the blow. Ultimately  this lends no insight to the interviewee and how they could improve in future interviews.  2) When choosing between 10 candidates  let’s assume maybe 4 have the qualifications needed and would do a “good job.” Between those four  you have to look at whose personality jives best with the rest of your team and would work well with students. I know our district didn’t hire someone this year because she talked like she was speaking to young children and we thought high schoolers would be bugged by the infantilization.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.2276923076923077,31830,

They also had to direct a small group of students through a new piece of music and he directed much like he interviewed  big  loud and all over the place. We went with a guy who interviewed and worked well with the kids.  In the end I really listened to what the kids had to say. A lot of them did not feel they could deal with the more loud  used car salesmen guy. One girl said  “I am not sure I would feel comfortable approaching him.”  He was from a different state so maybe that was the cultural norm where he was from but he really put me off. He had an offer on the table as we interviewed him from somewhere else anyway so I’m sure he’s doing fine somewhere.

But I’m disgusted that the powers that be in public schools withhold jobs from people essentially because they personally don’t like them. Also  schools are dynamic; the student body varies from year to year and each class has its own personality. There’s really no way a principal could know ahead of time whether the students and teachers for that particular year would mesh well.

They may have set up all interviews at once and not known the higher experience one would work out equally well. If they both interview well  experience as a deciding factor is totally reasonable.

It's all about love.  Love what you teach.  Love who you teach and love teaching.    2. Do the paperwork every day and on time.  That keeps the stress level down.    3. Keep it professional. Dress professionally   act professionally and expect to be treated professionally.   Keep a professional relationship with the kids.  They don't need a friend they need a teacher.    4. Ask for help from everyone for everything   from the principal to the lunch ladies.    5. You are human.   You are going to make mistakes.   Keep a journal.  Write them down and how you would do it better next year.  Next year you are going to really be glad you did  6.  The kids are going to push you until you break.  That's normal.   Don't break down in front of the kids.  At the end of the day. Lock the door   turn off the lights and cry your eyes out.  Then take a deep breath.  Remember that they're just kids and get back to work.    7. You are there to raise them up. Don't let them drag you down.  Arguing with a student is like wrestling with a pig.

You can of course use an online version of a calendar. But since my course is taught chronologically I simply take the number of chapters and spread them throughout the year (you will need to school calendar so holidays  state test dates  assemblies  etc can be planned in.) This will become part of your “scope and sequence” (the scope of what you need to teach and the order you do it.) This calendar is the back bone of ALL my lesson planning.   Then I tailor my classroom agreement. This document lays out all of my expectations for the year. We go over it the first day and kids take it home for a parents signature. This is where I put all classroom room rules. After kids bring them back I make a copy and we glue it into their journal. I do this so it is there for their reference at all times. (And I don’t like to have posted rules in my classroom.) This will establish expectations day one.   If you have a copy of Harry Wong’s book in class procedures  I strongly suggest that you skim it. (If not  get a copy.) He is an advocate for class procedures to make the teacher’s life easier and I totally agree.

I’m really excited and can’t wait to get started. That being said  I have no idea what I should be doing to actually GET started. I feel like there are so many places I could start and I’m not sure what to do. And then  I’m not sure how to start them.   Should I start planning content? Classroom rules? Write down my belief system and think about how to implement it in the classroom? And how do I do these things? Just sit with a notebook and start writing?

Become familiar with your state standards and check out your departments curriculum.  Talk to admin or other teachers to find out of school wide expectations or rules ( some schools have a behavior plan  require you to turn in a syllabus  or have a set activity they do on the first day of school  etc.)  Work on your syllabus.  Include grading scales  policy on late work  class rules  materials lists.  Again  check with school and department as different schools give different amounts of flexibity.  Check your department for a backbone pacing guide or make your own.  Plan for the first 3 or 4 weeks knowing that it won't go exactly as planned.  Have a detailed week one and a general plan for the following weeks which you will finish as they approach.  Make copies for the first week.  Decide on the format for your assignments (interactive notwbboks  binders  loose and turn in daily/weekly   etc).   Learn to use you gradebook.  Decorate your classroom.

Remember no matter how this year goes the next years will be better. Not that this year will be bad  but it takes some experience to really get into your groove.  The biggest thing I had to work on was classroom rules. Have your Expectations of your students (be respectful  come to class prepared  etc) clearly presented to your students and be Consistent with enforcing them. Enforcing is a harsh word so instead we say ""Redirect the student"" making sure they are aware of the expectations  usually done in private.  As far as lesson planning goes you want to backwards design starting with what the students are required to learn at the state level. Maybe there is a State Test the students take  or look up your state's 6th grade standards.  Save everything! I use Google Drive to save everything I make just in case I want to use it or modify it later.  Classroom culture is very important so that the students feel safe and able to express themselves without ridicule. So maybe balance your belief system and culture creation with curriculum and lesson planning.  Again Congratulations!

I actually found the plan in my dropbox and pasted it in here. So many of these procedures broke down pretty fast.   &#x200B;  My Plan  \------------------------------  First Day – Math 5th grade– period 1 - Room 201      **Central Focus**  Students   will learn the expectations  procedures and routines of the class.       **Opening Routine/Activities**  **(8:50-8:57)**  Greet students at door.  “Good Morning- Please find your   assigned seat and silently read over the syllabus.” Hand syllabus   Seating chart projected + hard copy   in case there are issues     **Main Learning Activities (8:57- 9:23)**     **Directions for Class:**  The teacher overviews and projects the expectations   for entry. (4 minutes)  1. Silently line up along the wall   outside of Ms. \*\*\*\*’s room  2. Greet Ms. \*\*\*\* and enter the   classroom silently  3. Take Do Now and walk to your assigned  seat  4. Take out any homework and materials  you will need  5. Start Do Now silently   6. If you have a question or need  something  raise your hand  **Begin the Task:**  Discuss rationale for entry   procedure and practice. (2 minutes)   I direct students to practice   entry. (6 minutes)  **Directions for Class:**  The teacher overviews and projects the expectations   for passing papers back. (3 minutes)  1. Pass the papers up each column to   the front of the room.  2. Once all the papers from a column   have reached the front row  pass the papers to the right.   The teacher overviews and projects the expectations   for passing papers to the teacher. (3 minutes)  **Directions for Class:**  The teacher overviews and projects the expectations  for participation and discussions.   1. Active listening   2. Respect  3. On task   Introduce clap. Talk with partner.   (2 minutes)   Clap (5 minutes)     **Closure Assessment**  **(9:23-9:30)**  Students write   down tomorrow’s homework  then complete and submit exit slip.  &#x200B;  RESULTS:   Students did not know the word syllabus so that confuses them. That passing papers thing was not reinforced and the diagram of how to do it was a waste. Later  I just would pick one or two students to collect or pass back stuff. The clap thing was a call for attention but I kept messing up the clap pattern. I've change it since to 'If you hear me  clap once...If you hear me clap twice...If you hear me clap three times..."" until everyone is doing it.  Silent entry is important. It did break down but if I could go back  I'd forget all the paper passing and focus on entering the class respectfully and make sure I was reinforcing the procedure every day. How students enter the class is super important. Chaotic entry = chaotic class.   &#x200B;  If you can get another teacher's info  preferably in your department and/or grade level  you should reach out and ask them for help about planning for the first day and what to expect.",,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.12776610644257702,31921,

Prep yourself as best you can for September. Review curriculum  plan ahead if you have that luxury.  Truthfully though  you will be taking it one day at a time  one class at a time.  **September is all about developing procedures**.  How do you want students to come in to your class? How do you want them to leave? How will you tell them what they need at the beginning of class? How do you want them to answer questions - raise their hand? Participation sticks? (sticks is better!) Think through all the actions of a student on their first day  and write down what you want their behaviour to be.  I literally had lessons on how to take the chromebooks from the cart and put them back.  A concocted premise  like ""make a video of yourself speaking french"" or something  but yeah - multiple lessons on the most basic of classroom functioning.  *The First Days of School* has multiple things that can help you with developing these procedures.  Rather than you coming up with the rules (Which are generally set by the school  in any case)  instead develop a lesson plan for having the students come up with class norms - expectations for behaviour in class.  I can't find mine at the moment  but this page has three really good ideas for this: [https://theartofeducation.edu/2017/08/08/3-benefits-creating-classroom-expectations-students/](https://theartofeducation.edu/2017/08/08/3-benefits-creating-classroom-expectations-students/)  Take the time to think through how you want your class to be set up.  To that plan  add a clock where you can see it with important times posted just for you  so you can keep track of the day.  I set up google calendar on my phone to chime when I had five minutes left in class  which was my ""tell them to put everything away"" signal.  What are you going to do to get to know the students  and get to know their names?  I used circles and comic strips - What was a time you got hurt/how could you have avoided it? makes for funny comic strips (literally four panels: two of the accident  one of how you took care of the injury  and one of how you could have avoided it.)  There are several resources online for talking circle procedures and questions.  Marking...k  so this how I made it through this past year (my first).  I wanted to write all the comments I'm supposed to  right? With the whole objective-what you did-what you could do structure and everything.  By Christmas I was a wreck and still had a six inch stack of marking. So my dad (former teacher  principal  and classroom behaviour specialist) sat me down and told me to pick one paper  ideally from a solid or good student and mark it.  Just the number - no comments.  He then told me to take the next paper and compare it to the first - was it better  or worse?  Great! Give that one a number accordingly.  Then the next  then the next.  This procedure  of using one as an archetype and point of reference made marking go much faster.  See I was not and am not *yet* at the point where I can give the full script of comments quickly and succinctly.  I am not there yet.  I will be  but not right now. For now  the students get a number on a page and I add only the comments to the ones who really need it or who really missed the mark.  I will get better  I am only starting out.  And so I have to cut myself a lot of slack when it comes to a great many things.  I am still learning them  I am not an expert  **I will get there.**   The other thing I learned about marking is about rubrics  and I got this from one of the board coaches: do not write a four-point rubric (we have a 4-3-2-1 grading system in intermediate)  only write the conditions for a 3 (outcome met).  A student can tell what is adding more or going beyond meeting the outcome  and they can tell what is only partially  or minimally understanding the outcome.  Let them fill in the blanks in their minds  I only need the explanation of how to obtain a 3.  So clear  one-point rubrics and using one paper as an archetype are my advice.",,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.1838806787082649,31923,

Keep in mind that it's not always a great idea to teach rules and procedures day 1  because everyone else will do that and kids will be overwhelmed. Also  schedules aren't always finalized the first few days  so the kids in your classes may change slightly.   The first week or so should include building relationships  collecting baseline data  and establishing classroom management. So create like 3-5 solid lessons to build classroom community then worry about curriculum. Like you could honestly spend a whole day practicing how to walk into class  attention getters  etc.   Feel free to DM me if you need extra idea.

To that end  I wanted to ask those of you who have both subbed and taught as regulars what your experiences were like. How many days a week/month were you typically called in and able to work? What are some differences in your contracts or expectations? Were you considered a full-time employee  or only part time? (I'm trying to figure out whether I need to plan on supplementing this with something else part time  like a retail or restaurant job.) Are subs eligible for any benefits  or were you on your own for insurance? Any other tips  advice  or things I should know?

I actually just interviewed for a full-time single-site sub job which will make me full time with benefits.   Subbing is a lot less stressful since you just pop on for a short time. You don't have to do the lesson planning  the regular teacher gives notes on what to expect so you skip the learning curve on which students are helpful and who shouldn't work with whom.   I love it  but it depends on the district. I've been in awesome schools with sweet  motivated kids that make teaching a joy. I've been in others (rural and urban) where each day you could probably play abuse bingo. Just read through the discipline policies at your schools and don't let anyone slide. Eventually  your reputation will grow and behavior will be less of a problem. If there's a school you don't feel like a good fit for  take them off your list.

Being the best sub in the world (or at least the best I can be) is appreciated more than most would think and will almost definitely be noticed.  Never been a full time teacher (hoping to change that this next year)  but have spent a considerable amount of time as a long term sub and a few weeks as a short term sub. I have worked in two title 1 schools as an LTS and one was miserable  the other was pretty good. But short term subbing was very rewarding for the brief time I did it.   As an experienced classroom teacher  you know pretty well what a good teacher would want from a sub  have all sorts of classriom management tricks  I would imagine  and have more flexibility and less stress than normal. When I was short term  I limited myself to high school and math positions  and kept away from schools I had issues with. Despite the limitations  the sub system got me positions nearly every day   running the gamut of high needs schools to top ranked public schools in wealthy suburbs. As soon as I got the spot  I would email the teacher asking for resources  course info  plans  and so on.   I spent the night before carefully studying the math concepts to be worked on the following day  and when I got worksheets  planning periods were spent making answer keys to streamline assistance and improve explanations. Sometimes I'd even give a brief explanation of a concept or derive a formula a student told me the teacher told them to memorize. I have had precalculus and calculus students' jaws drop when they saw what I was capable of. Several times I have been told that I was better than their actual teacher. One class even started plotting ways to get another math teacher fired so that I could replace them. I did not endorse these plots  for the record.   Students and teachers really appreciated my math expertise and dedication to student success. How I've never gotten any teaching job besides some subbing variation is beyond me. But use your skills and do what you can to help  and you should be in great shape. If I don't get a job this year  I'll be content with short term subbing some more to spread my name in the district and obtain glowing recs. NEVER AGAIN will I long term sub (unless it's an amazing school)  because I will never again work the job of a real teacher for only 3/5 the pay of a rookie teacher with a Bachelor's degree.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.203831569664903,31933,

This question (for me  at least) isn’t about reciting something you’ve learned off our website; it’s an opportunity to speak about one of your strengths.   Yes  I understand the “I need a job” aspect. That’s understood.   But take the opportunity to share something about yourself and how you’re going to enhance the work we do every day.   Example: “What interested me in School X? There are actually a lot of answers I could share  whether it is the opportunity to collaborate in a teaming situation  the opportunity to move up to a higher grade level  to work with a like-minded staff... but truly the main reason I applied is that I’ve been looking for a school community that puts kids first. I know this sounds like something from a first year teacher’s application  but it’s something that I believe strongly in and something that is a non-negotiable for me as an educator. While yes  it’s great to earn a salary and pay bills  but that’s not why I teach and that doesn’t define where I work... what interested me in your school and your school district is how there is a true sense of community  from Twitter posts  to what I hear around town  from what I have seen even through this interview... I believe you’re a school community that puts kids first and that’s something that directly aligns with my own personal beliefs as an educator. Great question.”  And if you’re feeling risky  you can always throw in a slight joke like “if this isn’t true (that it’s a school community that puts kids first)  please let me know soon... :)”  Essentially  while you’re complimenting them  you’re also showing how you align into their school culture and also how you work hard to support your students.

I love doing it. In 5 years I want to still be doing it. But that seems unambitious. So I say something about moving my students from guided projects to truly independent work.

That’s plenty.   And limit it to 1-2 comments like that. Anything more  and the candidate comes across as bitter or angry.   For the record  when I’ve had a candidate say that their last school was a mess **and I actually knew that school was a mess**  it didn’t give the candidate any extra points in the interview. It’s more like “duh  of course you want out of school X... it’s horrible there... and the pay is 20% less as well...”,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",-0.059292929292929286,31979,

898,PrincessOfPotatos,Landed the job!,I started pursuing my alternative certification almost a year ago  and was under the impression that I’d be hired immediately if I got a high need certification. I got certified in science  but months passed before I finally resigned myself that I wouldn’t get my own classroom for 2018-2019.   I joined the sub roster and started subbing at a few local schools  and discovered that middle school was the best place for me. (I know  I’m crazy)   After a month of subbing  I was contacted by one of the best middle schools in our district about a temporary TA position. I was hesitant  but took the job thinking I would tough it out and it would help me get experience.   I never would have expected that working in special education would be so rewarding and such a great fit for me. My one on one student was a handful  but the good days made all the bad days worth it.   At the end of the school year  I found out my position wasn’t funded for the next year. My heart broke thinking I wouldn’t be able to come back and thinking about all of the support my kiddo would be losing.   Our inclusion teacher retired  and I expressed interest in it before I left but didn’t hear anything definitive. A month passed and I started to worry that I would have to look for other positions for the fall  but my principal reached out to me and asked if I was still interested  which I very much was.

Having a sort of ""home base"" for your materials (supplies  papers  books  laptop  etc) will make a world of difference.  I would recommend seeing if you can install a file organizer on the wall outside of your office  and have that be where you leave papers for students to pick up if they were absent  as well as a place when students can turn work in. That way they don't need to go hunting you down.  And just in case your classes are on different floors of the building  make sure you have elevator access. I know many schools require the use of a key to operate the elevator  and if that is the situation you end up in  advocate for yourself and make it clear that you need to use it in order to do your job effectively and in a timely manner.",,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.1404040404040404,32004,0.207

You're always sacrificing something with your occupation whether it's your health  time with family  freedom  or in our case a higher wage. Finding what is comfortable for you depends on your non-negotiables. Some people on this thread have already said they also worked at McDonald's and how exhausting it was. Imagine that kind of discomfort in life and no outlet to do something else of a similar salary. Imagine making 60k and working like a dog day and night  then moving on to making 20k and having a lot less stress and reasonable work schedule. It really makes you evaluate what your time is worth. I was finishing my graduate degree and had 3 jobs at one point  now that I'm just teaching I am way more comfortable than having to run around like before.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.2236111111111111,32201,

My alma mater changed how they do education degrees to either primary  secondary  special ed  or early childhood education with specialized tracks based on what you want to teach. Secondary tracks in particular changed and degrees sound a little bit like what you just listed.  I don't know what college in particular you're talking about and how their curriculum/course study works so I can't get into the specifics but what that degree is essentially entailing is this. You'll learn all the science and theory of teaching in addition to the philosophies and major schools of thought. Alongside those courses  you'll be taking rigorous math courses and super specialized math courses. In my case  I took a lot of literary theory classes and specialized writing classes.  I once compared my degree to a sort of (but not exactly) double major. I took a lot of classes that an English major would take but I also took a lot of education related classes as well.

The school attended suggested this but did not advise him that he would have to attend school after he received his degree to get an alternative licensure. He did not know until he graduated he needed to file for an alternative licensure and enroll in an alternative licensure program.   However  it would allow you to switch fields if you ever decide teaching isn't for you  and it is only  if I'm remembering correctly  3 more semesters (in NM). In addition  the alternative licensure can also be combined with the Masters program (takes just a bit longer than only doing the alternative licensure)  so you could have a master's when you become fully licensed.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.0625,32308,

No one talked about teaching 18 year old high school students. I taught 9th and 12th only so my day was a roller coaster. No one tells you about senior slide  full-on apathy and this is from seniors who had really high GPAs. They were better behaved of course than my freshman but it was all just different.

And it's not until they get the support  understanding  and relationships that they NEED  that they will truly blossom. There's one chapter where he attends a birthday party and is very out of place. And it makes me sad  because something as simple as attending a birthday party is so unknown and foreign to him. Up until that chapter in the book  he had never been invited to a birthday party in his life. And the character in the book is like a 5th grader. It makes me think about our kids who don't KNOW what they are doing because they never experience it and NEED teachers to show them what to do  proper etiquette and expectations  etc.   It's such a great book and I think would be wonderful to share with students as a way to really talk about the need for understanding of people who are (or perceived to be) ""different"" from us.

Either TX or the Fed (can't remember which) made it mandatory for public school workers to be paid in 24 pay periods otherwise they'd add a 20% tax to paychecks. So districts decided to do the 24 paychecks. Depending on whether your district is DoI (District of Innovation) will determine when your first paycheck is. My contract starts August 6th and we get our first paycheck August 31st.  A lot of districts have a new hire meeting that must be attended by all new hires before school starts.

Then we discuss ways in which they can achieve these goals  and what kind of learner they need to be to get there. This moves into what kind of learning environment is needed to get there  and eventually how they can help their peers succeed in achieving their goals. This can tie in personal electronics  as that can hinder the learning process  for example. EDIT: we then write up our constitution based on this discussion on chart paper and it goes on the wall.

I just really hate icebreakers. To answer the question. I don’t force anything. It’s counterproductive in my opinion. Students tend to crawl out of their shells given time and a little trust. It doesn’t happen quickly but it happens.   And what palsh7 is saying is really important. Trying to force things outside a student’s developmental timeline (great phrase by the way) just backfires. It throws the shy kids under the bus  it forces an audience on to the class clown  the smart kids feel taken advantage of.   To forge Meaningful bonds requires authentic interaction. Think about all the times you’ve made a meaningful connection with someone. It didn’t happen because you played a memory game that everyone either all won or all lost depending on how you feel about remembering stuff  it because you worked with someone to accomplish something authentically meaningful.   If you really want to bond your class together do a weekly circle. The book “circle forward” is probably the best guide book out there.  Start with norms and values. Make sure you are facilitating the circle not controlling it (you’ll want to hand it off to students as soon as possible). Give everyone a chance to speak but force no one.   But honestly the best thing to do is forget the time wasters and start giving people work. Dive right in. Pile it on. First day. Make them curse your name. Be the mean teacher who expects the impossible. Offer a single thread of salvation which is working with another student for mutual survival.  Make sure they fully understand the concept “I am not your friend. I am your teacher”  Edit: I tend to be a little dramatic. I guess working with teenagers is starting to rub off. Take the last paragraph with a grain of salt. They shouldn’t literally be cursing your name.  But just because I’m being slightly hyperbolic doesn’t mean I didnt mean the essence of what I said.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.07967261904761905,32470,

(Especially a lot more than just saying “We don’t do them”) This explains a side that I didn’t consider.  You’re right. I can’t recall any “Ice-breakers” being something authentic & memorable and I’m more of a stranger to the students so they really don’t need any help getting to know each other.  Also the developmental timeline is something I definitely didn’t consider. I just expected that it’s kind of our responsibility to help push student’s into being more open/social but I can see now that ice-breakers are NOT the way to do it.

It teaches a technique out of a Native American tradition. They use it for something called restorative justice. It’s a way of resolving conflict by trying to restore relationships instead of seeking punishment. The relatively point here is that while it can also do those things it requires building a community which is what you want. Their means is your end. When I first started to do them it was really hard for me to let go and NOT control the circle because as a teacher most of the time I DO need to control the classroom. But there is a time and place for letting go and that is in a circle. Kids won’t respond to it otherwise. It took a few weeks of practice but eventually I was able to turn it over to students to facilitate. It was a really unique experience. I have nothing to urge when it comes to circles. It was helpful for me. It might be helpful to others.   Here’s what you do your first day instead of an ice breaker. Get 4-5 huge sheets of poster paper. In big marker ask one question on each sheet. Something about what they want in a classroom. What works. What doesn’t work. What should be changed. What’s important to them. What strategies are going to be successful what goals do they have. You get the idea. Then do a gallery walk (you can google “gallery walk” if you want some more specific ideas). After that if you still have time you can have someone in the group present their ideas and reflect on the feedback. After that if there’s still time give them class work,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.23137254901960785,32473,

After everyone started finding out I wasn’t getting hired  a few teachers actually told me how bothered they were about it.

The kids who are hurting aren't  usually  willing to hurt someone when they're in a good spot. We had discussed how nice it feels to receive compliments and how powerful those compliments  even the little ones  can be. One less-than-popular girl had written that a popular boy she didn't know seemed like he was a great friend to his friends. He asked who it was  she was willing to admit it was her  he told her they were now friends  and she was ecstatic.

I set up a circuit that runs through the entire room. (One year I could only manage something like an S and then had to constantly run from one end of the S to the other  bringing papers across.)   I then have students put their names on the bottom of the paper and have students practice passing the paper along the circuit once or twice (you could reverse the name and passing  but I think it helps with some anonymity to have the first compliment not come from the person who literally sits right next to you).   Then I have students look at the name on the bottom  write one nice thing at the top  and fold the top over to keep their sentence private.   I tell students that I’ll be collecting papers and if they write anything inappropriate  they won’t get theirs back. (Truth be told  the one year I did have two inappropriate comments  they may have been inside jokes  so I just had them erase and write new comments.)   Works pretty well.

1530,ShammgodandManatMU,Got a job. Why am I not as happy as I thought I’d be?,I’ve been looking for a job for about two years. I went to school for Social Studies  but I added an ELA endorsement this past spring.  Had a few interviews last summer and a bunch more this summer. I was frustrated with the lack of progress after each one  and kept wondering where I would end up. This came to a head about two weeks ago  when I had back to back amazing interviews for Social Studies openings with solid schools in pretty good locations (We’ll call them the Manic Pixie Dream Jobs) and lost out on both. I was really crushed.      Fast forward to Monday. I interview for a ELA job at a county about 90 minutes from my house. Am I as allured by the position  school and location as I was with the Manic Pixie Dream Jobs? Not quite. But the admin was really nice  the school looked to be a good community  and I felt like they wanted me  which I rarely ever feel. I have my interview and feel like I did well  but not as great as with the MPDJ. The next day  I get a call from the county school district  telling me I’ve been recommended for the job.

I was really crushed.      Fast forward to Monday. I interview for a ELA job at a county about 90 minutes from my house. Am I as allured by the position  school and location as I was with the Manic Pixie Dream Jobs? Not quite.

You had some good times and some rough times.  When you got to the last drop (graduation)  you were suspended a little longer than expected  and you began to think that the ride was broken.  When you got the job  you had that final rush down  and now you're off the ride.  You don't feel the rush of being on the ride yet  but you haven't gotten on a new one yet.  You're just walking around the park in the hot sun.  When school starts  you'll get on a new ride - one that is slightly different from the ride that you thought you would get on after the roller coaster because it is closed for maintenance.  The great thing about teaching ELA is that you get to teach ANYTHING.****  You can teach ELA through social studies  so intentionally.  In fact  being a social studies-minded person makes you an expert at teaching informational texts and writing!  Just brush up on the literacy components.  ****That comment in no way was meant to devalue ELA teachers or assume that they don't have standards.  Lol.

My original license is in social studies  and after I didn’t get a job during my first year trying  I went to grad school and got my endorsement (and masters) in gifted Ed. I landed a job teaching gifted language arts for 6/7/8. My feeling was more relieved than excited. It was a long commute (60 minutes though  compared to your 90! Wow!!) but it was a job.   I’ve been there for four years. I enjoy my job  I love my coworkers  I’ve got a GREAT contract  etc. etc. but it’s still not what I wanted. I’m interviewing for a HS social studies position at a closer school and I’m so excited but so terrified for the exact feelings you listed before.   What has helped me get through the difficult patches for the last four years was finding the parts I enjoy  and then working on my resume. I kept reminding myself that I was getting teaching experience which would be beneficial when I applied for jobs at the end of the year.   Hopefully you enjoy what you are doing and find yourself in a supportive environment!

I was frustrated with the lack of progress after each one  and kept wondering where I would end up. This came to a head about two weeks ago  when I had back to back amazing interviews for Social Studies openings with solid schools in pretty good locations (We’ll call them the Manic Pixie Dream Jobs) and lost out on both. I was really crushed.      Fast forward to Monday. I interview for a ELA job at a county about 90 minutes from my house. Am I as allured by the position  school and location as I was with the Manic Pixie Dream Jobs? Not quite. But the admin was really nice  the school looked to be a good community  and I felt like they wanted me  which I rarely ever feel. I have my interview and feel like I did well  but not as great as with the MPDJ. The next day  I get a call from the county school district  telling me I’ve been recommended for the job. I accept without hesitance  and have the letter of intent emailed to me. I was shocked. All those days subbing and all those nights emailing countless principals  and here it was. But for something that had been on my mind for months  my number one goal...I wasn’t as happy as I’d thought I’d be. No dancing  no screaming around the house...just this moment of disbelief.     Three days since that call  and not much has changed. The letter of intent has yet to be signed and scanned. I’m very grateful for this job  and excited to see what I can do  but there’s still all these worries and concerns in my head. How good of a job can I do when my ELA experience consists of a few days subbing for teachers in the subject? One of the MPDJ has another Social Studies opening  what if I could get that one? And this isn’t mentioning finding an apartment and leaving home  which I know I need to do at 27  plus something I’ve been anticipating with excitement for years  but yet I still have these pangs of sadness over leaving the house I called home for 22 years.      I got everything I wanted and I’m not as happy as I should be. I feel ungrateful and greedy. Is this a case of there being more that meets the eye  or am I just being unrealistic?,self,No video,2019-07-13 08:48:15,15.0,22.0,10.0,DC1346,Perhaps you've been chasing after this so long  that your mind (and heart) haven't caught up with the fact that you have achieved your goal. It also sounds as though you're not keen on leaving home to find an apartment.   I can tell you that if you don't sign and return the letter of intent PROMPTLY  your job will go to whomever was next on the list for the district in terms of qualified candidates.   I know from personal experience that procrastination won't make the problem go away. If you do take this job  you're just going to make it more difficult for yourself because every day you lose is one day less for you to find an apartment and to move. You will also have utilities to connect and groceries to purchase and stock. You may need to purchase furniture. You'll also want time to unpack.   If you are NOT going to take this job  you need to be considerate of the district and whoever replaces you in this slot by giving the district timely notice that you have reconsidered and will not be taking the job.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",-0.036111111111111115,32630,

What would you want from your administrator on your first day in the faculty meeting?  Having high expectations and being nice aren't mutually exclusive. In fact  I'd say that the kids are much more likely to want to meet your expectations if they feel that you like them (and that they like you). Building relationships will always be more powerful than a power trip. Be you  let them be them  and make your expectations clear and concise. The kids will rise to meet you.   Once they have a relationship with you  saying that you expected better from them (for most kids) will do much more than being intentionally serious or strict.

Routines are things the kids do every day. Procedures are things they do some of the time. Most of your behavior issues will be solved with very specific routines and procedures. Both need to be taught for your class. What's the routine for walking into class? How do they turn in work? What do they do if they need the restroom? Can they get out of their seat and sharpen a pencil? How much can they talk during work time?      And then whatever you decide you have to practice it with them... many times over.

1590,cauchy7,Ideas for Surveying Lesson for Trig Class,So last year  I started teaching Honors Trig  and had a fun idea to have a local engineering firm come in and do a presentation about surveying  and possibly some kind of demonstration where the kids get to use one.  It took me all school year  but I finally found a firm that will do it (and they are excited!) about a month ago.  They asked me to tell them what kinds of things they should talk about / do ... and I'm not entirely sure!  I was thinking about having them just describe what it is  and then we could go down to the school parking lot and do something with that - maybe look through the transit to find measurements.  This would obviously take more than one day.  &#x200B;  I'm a little stuck on what I should tell him to focus on  and how I might structure an activity around this.  Anyone have any ideas?,self,No video,2019-07-13 15:47:21,8.0,4.0,7.0,cauchy7,My grandfather makes kites for kids (long story). I had him come in and we made kites. The kids in my Trig classes (mostly juniors) really liked it  especially the boys. They ran around the auditorium flying them in the air. The next day  we went out to the parking lot with protractors and they literally RAN around the parking lot with their kites. We were trying to find the height. We weren't too successful  but they had a blast running around the parking lots. Again  16 & 17 year olds (mostly the boys) laughing gleefully  pulling a kite through the air.

Every discussion I had with admin about my intentions to leave ended with me in tears because I cared so deeply about the kids and the profession that I didn’t want to leave  but I felt I would be doing myself a disservice to not allow myself to explore other options. No matter what your job is  most people would agree that it isn’t healthy to have your entire life revolve around it. Furthermore  I honestly believe I would be a better teacher for taking time for myself. Giving myself the chance to do something else and then figuring out that there’s nothing else out there for me.  And absolutely schools aren’t doing well preparing teachers. Absolutely teachers are leaving the profession at an alarming rate. There’s a reason for that and it’s not because the teachers who left were evil and “bailed” on their students. They’re doing the best they can to live fulfilling lives and they honestly don’t feel that the teaching profession—in its current state in the US—is going to be that for them.

I’m really torn right now and not sure what my next step should be. Do I continue on my path to a better paying and potentially more respected profession? Or do I go back to teaching where the only positive of the job is the children I care so much about?  Again  sorry for the weird post. I don’t even really know what I expect to gain from this. I just needed somewhere to vent my feelings. Having trouble sleeping.,self,No video,2019-07-13 22:05:34,15.0,0.0,9.0,jackspedicey,Actually  no. My mentor teacher and every other teacher in the school literally congratulated me when I said I was leaving. That’s what reassured me that I must’ve been doing the right thing to resign. Literally no one was happy and they always discussed what other careers they would choose if they could go back in time. Maybe the area I’m in is worse for teachers than where you are. And as you said yourself  teachers aren’t being prepared by their schooling for the reality of the profession. Given that knowledge  it would seem that you would be more caring towards teachers who felt completely overwhelmed by their first year. But what do I know?,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.1285714285714286,32739,
