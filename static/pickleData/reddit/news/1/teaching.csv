6,Geck014,Parents going to the principals about me as a teacher after their child lies about something that happened in class,Does this happen to anyone else? This has happened to me a handful of times and it really makes me angry.   It happened last year a few times when a child would always go home and lie to his step mother about things I did or didn’t do in class e.g. if he felt another kid ‘bullied’ him when this original boy had been annoying the other boy and I didn’t discipline the other kid. She would come marching in and yell at me.   I am now working in a school in a different country  language and culture to my own.  This year parents have gone to the principal complain to the principal about me. The first instance was when I was given the instruction by my boss to let all children be immunised unless they had brought back the permission slip saying NOT to. Turns out one kid had already had got the injection and accidentally then got a second one  his parents flipped their shit and went straight to the principal about me. The day after they did this they found the permission slip he had not given them from a week ago was still sitting in his school bag.  Today a child’s parents went straight to the Principal about me after one of my students had been tripped another student last week and got massive scrapes on him.  It was a really busy lunchtime but I cleaned his wounds  bandaged him up  gave him some stickers and then sat him on a seat for the rest of the day. I spoke to the boy who tripped him and he said he was sorry and it was an ‘accident’.  When the boys sister came to pick him up I told her he had been tripped up by mistake  but I’d cleaned him up and put bandages on but he’s OK and might be a bit sore.   Anyway  today the parents came in and told the principal their child’s leg had swelled up over the weekend because I told him to keep the plaster on (why the hell would I say this)  they told me they weren’t informed that he was hurt) I told the big sister when she picked him up) and they were going on about the kid that tripped him (he insisted it was an accident and said sorry). Anyway I basically told them what really happened and they didn’t really say much after that. I think maybe they realised their kid had just made stuff up.   It really upsets me when they bypass me to go straight to my boss  only to be proven that their kid was lying or they were told the wrong information. I had an awful boss and team leader in the past so it gives me such bad anxiety whenever parents go to her first and she has to call me over.  So afterwards I spoke with the principal and I told her it really frustrates me that parents don’t come to me because it makes me look like I’m not doing my job properly. She said she knows I am and that’s why she got me to go in and chat to them about it because it didn’t sound right to her.   Anyway I’m going to give a notice out to parents to come to see me in the first instance if there are any issues as I’m the class teacher  and I can explain the actual situation that happened.  Anyone else get really angry when parents try to throw them under the bus like this? Just make me so mad.  Edit: Thanks everyone for all your suggestions! Will take the ones onboard that I can use. I live in a developing country at a local school in the islands so we have no use of computers  cell phones for contact with parents but I will definitely try to speak with them before/after school or send notes home for issues that happen! I’ll also start a log book for any more major incidents so I know who to contact.

A parent emailed my principal pictures of her child’s “swollen” eye (literally she was fine) after another kid bumped her face when he was raising his hand. The girl changed the story to “he stabbed me in the eye with a pencil” and the parent flipped out and went over my head about the “bullying” her child was enduring... so frustrating.

The principal gets to see what I'm dealing with and might save me the bother of it. Though I 100% agree it depends on your leader  I trust mine to have my back and also to be professional if I've stuffed up.  The immunisation complaint should go to the principal because their process was very flawed  you don't rely on a child doing the logistics for medical care. You should need a note either way and have someone chase it up if there's no note.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",-0.14166666666666666,32749,

In my district  fifth grade is all 1:1 with iPads  and it’s generally up to the teacher/school whether the kids can take iPads home or not. My partner teacher and I decided not to let them take them home. (For my class in particular  if they left the iPad at home  they would have a very hard time keeping up with classwork.)  Anyway  one of my students (a well-behaved  likeable fellow) told his parents that he was upset because his class didn’t get to take the iPads home  but the other class did (NOT TRUE) and that he didn’t like that I would sometime take away their extra recess because a few kids were talking (hint: it was most of them  and usually him  too). Well  his parents came into the principals office in a rage about all of this. Thank god she had my back  because my previous principal was all about taking the parents’ side about everything. (To the point where a first grade teacher had to provide detailed lesson plans to a parent who was concerned her son wasn’t being challenged enough 🙄)  Also  had a third grade teacher whose kid went home and told her mom that the class was throwing spaghetti around the classroom in a food fight type thing.   What’s that meme: Parents  I promise not to believe everything your child says happens at home if you promise not to believe everything they say happens at school.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.004427083333333332,32752,

This has happened to me a handful of times and it really makes me angry.   It happened last year a few times when a child would always go home and lie to his step mother about things I did or didn’t do in class e.g. if he felt another kid ‘bullied’ him when this original boy had been annoying the other boy and I didn’t discipline the other kid. She would come marching in and yell at me.   I am now working in a school in a different country  language and culture to my own.

The first instance was when I was given the instruction by my boss to let all children be immunised unless they had brought back the permission slip saying NOT to. Turns out one kid had already had got the injection and accidentally then got a second one  his parents flipped their shit and went straight to the principal about me. The day after they did this they found the permission slip he had not given them from a week ago was still sitting in his school bag.  Today a child’s parents went straight to the Principal about me after one of my students had been tripped another student last week and got massive scrapes on him.  It was a really busy lunchtime but I cleaned his wounds  bandaged him up  gave him some stickers and then sat him on a seat for the rest of the day. I spoke to the boy who tripped him and he said he was sorry and it was an ‘accident’.  When the boys sister came to pick him up I told her he had been tripped up by mistake  but I’d cleaned him up and put bandages on but he’s OK and might be a bit sore.   Anyway  today the parents came in and told the principal their child’s leg had swelled up over the weekend because I told him to keep the plaster on (why the hell would I say this)  they told me they weren’t informed that he was hurt) I told the big sister when she picked him up) and they were going on about the kid that tripped him (he insisted it was an accident and said sorry). Anyway I basically told them what really happened and they didn’t really say much after that. I think maybe they realised their kid had just made stuff up.

I had an awful boss and team leader in the past so it gives me such bad anxiety whenever parents go to her first and she has to call me over.  So afterwards I spoke with the principal and I told her it really frustrates me that parents don’t come to me because it makes me look like I’m not doing my job properly.

And I email/send a Class Dojo message to the parent before the student leaves school so they hear from me first the details of the injury/mishap.

I gave out a a quiz and was very clear on not talking. Sure enough  he talked. Took his quiz and ripped it. I had to stick to my guns on that one as I promised that.  He spinned it so it seemed like I was singleing him out throughout the quarter and I didn't give him what he needed to pass the quiz. Mom was going to try and get me kicked out of student teachin and was ticked.  He had done this to other teachers and administaration was aware of this.

It would also help if you were forthcoming in your level of experience and training.  That said  there likely two possibilities the parents are so assertive and aggressive.  One is that you're a foreigner  which they mayfeel intimidated by. They likely feel you won't understand them. So they go to the principal instead to air their greivences.  Second is that in some cultures  parents have authority over their child's education. So much so  they look for any excuse to demand their fees back. This can corrupt the merit of the child's education. Did the student actually lass or did the parent have some hand in this?  Further  if one parent threatens to sue the school  it could start a wave of all parents asking for their fees back. This sort of thing can actually break a school.  Such cultural instances here are usually found in developing countries  such as in SEA.  Other reasons could be the parents own experiences with foreigners  in your school before you arrived. Maybe there was some American who arrived in classes drunk  so forth.  In which case  you may feel you needn't take it personally.  The good news is  is that as you are a foreigner to that country  it would have cost a lot more money to hire you than it would a native teacher. Therefore  it will have to take a lot for them to fire you.  And you must have something they want for them to hire you in the first place.  Point is  it's really difficult to acheive anything when teaching in another country. Often  you just can't win.  You do need to build different interpersonal skills and be able to compromise your own standards with the culture.  Find your bottom line- are you there to make money  to explore another culture or to teach- and stick with it. Anything else is just noise.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.0830357142857143,32757,

They care about what happens to them. If they come home and something happens in a way that they do not like or see as dangerous or whatever (a moving target for each parent) then they want to hold someone or something accountable.   I would argue it's pretty unavoidable because of the nature of the job  and I know we all have too much to do on a given day already  but if you open up the lines of communication to the parents and admin for these parents that are so hands on then you are covering your ass in multiple ways. You let the admin know what will happen when the parents come and how it looked on your side. You let the parents know what happens so they can compare to what the child said. And you are now blameless if they go over your head and confront you because then you have gone ahead and already reached out to them.   It's a rough spot  I understand. But parents that care will always be better than the parents who don't. I work in a pretty ""bad"" area where the parents couldn't be bothered a moment for how their child is doing and the students are acting out non-stop. So naturally I'll call and e-mail home constantly to have no reply and leave unheard voicemails. Then one day out of the blue  the child act better (for a short period of time) and I'll ask why and it's not because the parents wanted better of the student  but rather because the parent did not want to be bothered with voicemails and e-mails.",,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.056250000000000015,32759,
20,Geck014,Parents going to the principals about me as a teacher after their child lies about something that happened in class,Does this happen to anyone else? This has happened to me a handful of times and it really makes me angry.   It happened last year a few times when a child would always go home and lie to his step mother about things I did or didn’t do in class e.g. if he felt another kid ‘bullied’ him when this original boy had been annoying the other boy and I didn’t discipline the other kid. She would come marching in and yell at me.   I am now working in a school in a different country  language and culture to my own.  This year parents have gone to the principal complain to the principal about me. The first instance was when I was given the instruction by my boss to let all children be immunised unless they had brought back the permission slip saying NOT to. Turns out one kid had already had got the injection and accidentally then got a second one  his parents flipped their shit and went straight to the principal about me. The day after they did this they found the permission slip he had not given them from a week ago was still sitting in his school bag.  Today a child’s parents went straight to the Principal about me after one of my students had been tripped another student last week and got massive scrapes on him.  It was a really busy lunchtime but I cleaned his wounds  bandaged him up  gave him some stickers and then sat him on a seat for the rest of the day. I spoke to the boy who tripped him and he said he was sorry and it was an ‘accident’.  When the boys sister came to pick him up I told her he had been tripped up by mistake  but I’d cleaned him up and put bandages on but he’s OK and might be a bit sore.   Anyway  today the parents came in and told the principal their child’s leg had swelled up over the weekend because I told him to keep the plaster on (why the hell would I say this)  they told me they weren’t informed that he was hurt) I told the big sister when she picked him up) and they were going on about the kid that tripped him (he insisted it was an accident and said sorry). Anyway I basically told them what really happened and they didn’t really say much after that. I think maybe they realised their kid had just made stuff up.   It really upsets me when they bypass me to go straight to my boss  only to be proven that their kid was lying or they were told the wrong information. I had an awful boss and team leader in the past so it gives me such bad anxiety whenever parents go to her first and she has to call me over.  So afterwards I spoke with the principal and I told her it really frustrates me that parents don’t come to me because it makes me look like I’m not doing my job properly. She said she knows I am and that’s why she got me to go in and chat to them about it because it didn’t sound right to her.   Anyway I’m going to give a notice out to parents to come to see me in the first instance if there are any issues as I’m the class teacher  and I can explain the actual situation that happened.

First in the future try to preemptively bond with the parents over anything you can think of about Johnny/Jenny: “Such imagination!” “She really loves math/sports/helping doesn’t she?” Not only will this put you and the parent on the same side  it will help you and little Johnny/Jenny bond a bit too. Do not underestimate the power of validating someone’s worth  even when you have to really work to find it. Second  get in the habit of documenting things that happen in the classroom especially once you’ve identified a problem area. It is a pain and will take more time than you want  but it will be SO helpful when you have to talk to That Parent  or worse.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.06634615384615385,32760,

Many of these parents would be pissed if it happened to them.  It underscores a lack of value for our profession.  And of course none really apologize for going over ur head when they realize they are wrong bc in their mind it was extremely urgent and their actions were necessary.  I dont want to sound like i am blaming u for their actions bc clearly its a reflection of them.  However  id love to make some suggestions that have worked for me.  ive found that reaching out to all parents at the beginning if the year helps minimize this.  I text them and include their childs name in the text so i can easily search it later and provide updates.  I also include the term ""math teacher"" in my text so parents can search their texts easily as well.  (Or  i call to say hi and then follow up by text.) Each text emphasizes they can always reach out to me with any questions or concerns.  Another thing that has helped is even if the parent goes over ur head and everyone has to meet  always ask them if they have your contact info (phone  email or whatever) and offer to give it to them again.  Even tho theyve basically implied thru their actions that ur a heartless idiot (and none of us appreciate that)  it helps minimize this habit and maybe help educate the parent.  It doesnt feel satisfying to cater to this type of behavior but ultimately it helps me feel mpre peace w the issue.  It sounds like we may teach different age groups as well so hopefully you dont have as many ppl to reach out to.  Imo  personalized contact is better than a letter going home.  The latter may come across as condescending and close down communixation.  If u do send home that letter  id run it by ur principal first for last edits (in case parents go to him/her with complaints re: the letter).  Ultimately  each parent was worried about their kid and took the steps they thought were necessary.  Yes  their actions were laden w judgment  but none of us are perfect.",,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.14754273504273507,32761,

I know it’s because I’m a young teacher (25 going into my 4th year teaching). What helps for me is communicating with the parents OFTEN. I send remind 101 messages at least every other day  I send notes home constantly (make sure some are positive like “caught you being awesome” awards)  I have students call parents the second something happens  etc. This way we already have a line of communication open so they are more likely to speak to me. Also  having the kids call is great because it doesn’t take any of my time. I have sticky notes on my desk  so if the parents want to talk to me I tell the kid to let them know I’ll call back after school and then the kid puts a sticky on my computer as a reminder. I absolutely will not get on the phone while I’m in class. I just explain that during that time  my attention is already divided 25 ways.

I know how busy you probably already are  so this may not be realistic for you  but if you have time to be proactive about communicating with parents it might help them develop a better picture of what’s going on and feel natural about reaching out to you first. For example  if a kid gets injured call the parents as soon as you have a chance just to give them a heads up about what happened and how it’s been handled (and if kid is okay  let them know like Hey Ms B  it’s Tommy’s teacher. Just wanted to give you a heads up that on the playground today Tommy and another kid collided during tag and Tommy scraped his knee up. He’s okay  we got his knee cleaned up and he’s got a bandaid and he’s back to playing with friends now  but I’ll keep an eye on it this afternoon. Do you have any questions? Ok thanks  let me know if anything else comes up”.   About the “bullying”  I had a kid this year who insisted to his mom that his friend was bullying him when really they were good friends but fought all the time and it went both ways. The mom wasn’t rude about it  just let me know she was worried  so I thanked her for telling me  and told her I would watch for it  then would occasionally update her about what I observed  including a message the next day letting her know I watched the boys interaction closely the next couple days  they consistently chose to play together and I didn’t notice any bullying from the other boy  although I did witness her son taunting the other boy about knocking over his tower and so I separated them. If I did see any problems between the boys  I would also send her a quick message or tell her in person at pick up  like “hey just so you know  this afternoon Ike and Devi had a disagreement when Devi wouldnt share his blocks and Ike called him a name.  We talked about sharing and name calling and they decided they would take a break from playing together for a bit  but they seem to have made up and wanted to sit together at snack. Let me know if anything else comes up or you have any questions.”   It’s hard for parents when they don’t really know or see what’s going on for their kid all day  and lots of parents assume their kids are angels and that they would never lie or skew stories for pity/attention/to get out of trouble  and it’s a hard choice to decide your kid is lying and risk being wrong and damaging that relationship.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.07142857142857144,32765,

So afterwards I spoke with the principal and I told her it really frustrates me that parents don’t come to me because it makes me look like I’m not doing my job properly. She said she knows I am and that’s why she got me to go in and chat to them about it because it didn’t sound right to her.

If a kid gets hurt  write down what action you take after and what you say to the kids. It sucks  but it might be worth it to cover your ass. Fortunately  I can do all this electronically and send the log to parents or Assistant Principals  so it's a bit easier for me.

See if you can look at this a different way: let your admin screen these problems for you  so you don't have to be bothered unless they have questions.  Not having to deal directly with angry parents is one of the benefits they can provide for you.  Beyond that  I'll just echo what others have said: preemptively communicate with parents  and document everything with objective facts.  Getting pulled into the emotion is just encouraging some parents.  You don't want to volunteer yourself to be part of the drama.  When you're dealing with someone who is being emotional  be the adult in the room who points out the facts.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",-0.007142857142857145,32767,

34,Geck014,Parents going to the principals about me as a teacher after their child lies about something that happened in class,Does this happen to anyone else? This has happened to me a handful of times and it really makes me angry.   It happened last year a few times when a child would always go home and lie to his step mother about things I did or didn’t do in class e.g. if he felt another kid ‘bullied’ him when this original boy had been annoying the other boy and I didn’t discipline the other kid. She would come marching in and yell at me.   I am now working in a school in a different country  language and culture to my own.  This year parents have gone to the principal complain to the principal about me. The first instance was when I was given the instruction by my boss to let all children be immunised unless they had brought back the permission slip saying NOT to. Turns out one kid had already had got the injection and accidentally then got a second one  his parents flipped their shit and went straight to the principal about me. The day after they did this they found the permission slip he had not given them from a week ago was still sitting in his school bag.  Today a child’s parents went straight to the Principal about me after one of my students had been tripped another student last week and got massive scrapes on him.  It was a really busy lunchtime but I cleaned his wounds  bandaged him up  gave him some stickers and then sat him on a seat for the rest of the day. I spoke to the boy who tripped him and he said he was sorry and it was an ‘accident’.  When the boys sister came to pick him up I told her he had been tripped up by mistake  but I’d cleaned him up and put bandages on but he’s OK and might be a bit sore.   Anyway  today the parents came in and told the principal their child’s leg had swelled up over the weekend because I told him to keep the plaster on (why the hell would I say this)  they told me they weren’t informed that he was hurt) I told the big sister when she picked him up) and they were going on about the kid that tripped him (he insisted it was an accident and said sorry). Anyway I basically told them what really happened and they didn’t really say much after that. I think maybe they realised their kid had just made stuff up.   It really upsets me when they bypass me to go straight to my boss  only to be proven that their kid was lying or they were told the wrong information. I had an awful boss and team leader in the past so it gives me such bad anxiety whenever parents go to her first and she has to call me over.  So afterwards I spoke with the principal and I told her it really frustrates me that parents don’t come to me because it makes me look like I’m not doing my job properly. She said she knows I am and that’s why she got me to go in and chat to them about it because it didn’t sound right to her.   Anyway I’m going to give a notice out to parents to come to see me in the first instance if there are any issues as I’m the class teacher  and I can explain the actual situation that happened.  Anyone else get really angry when parents try to throw them under the bus like this? Just make me so mad.  Edit: Thanks everyone for all your suggestions! Will take the ones onboard that I can use.

I used to tell my student teachers to channel their inner Beyoncé. Beyoncé doesn’t chase her fans looking for approval - they chase her. So don’t be so quick to apologize or explain. Develop a poker face. Pass out business cards at the beginning of the school year and set limits about when you are available to answer questions. Instead of rushing to explain things  use the poker face and ask ‘ Can you tell me more about that?’  Or ‘Can you give me more context around  what Theon Greyjoy told you.’  As a society  we seem to automatically assume that older people already have these boundaries  and that works in favour of the older teacher. But you can build them. Start with practicing your Clint Eastwood stone face. (I know this makes me sound like a jerk  but you will get pulled in far too many directions to be effective if you don’t set limits.),,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.2928205128205128,32777,

This has happened to me a handful of times and it really makes me angry.   It happened last year a few times when a child would always go home and lie to his step mother about things I did or didn’t do in class e.g. if he felt another kid ‘bullied’ him when this original boy had been annoying the other boy and I didn’t discipline the other kid. She would come marching in and yell at me.   I am now working in a school in a different country  language and culture to my own.

Turns out one kid had already had got the injection and accidentally then got a second one  his parents flipped their shit and went straight to the principal about me. The day after they did this they found the permission slip he had not given them from a week ago was still sitting in his school bag.  Today a child’s parents went straight to the Principal about me after one of my students had been tripped another student last week and got massive scrapes on him.  It was a really busy lunchtime but I cleaned his wounds  bandaged him up  gave him some stickers and then sat him on a seat for the rest of the day. I spoke to the boy who tripped him and he said he was sorry and it was an ‘accident’.  When the boys sister came to pick him up I told her he had been tripped up by mistake  but I’d cleaned him up and put bandages on but he’s OK and might be a bit sore.   Anyway  today the parents came in and told the principal their child’s leg had swelled up over the weekend because I told him to keep the plaster on (why the hell would I say this)  they told me they weren’t informed that he was hurt) I told the big sister when she picked him up) and they were going on about the kid that tripped him (he insisted it was an accident and said sorry).

Not all of them  but more than in previous generations  and they tend to be the vocal ones.  They don't come to the teacher because they see the teacher as the threat  so they go to the administrator hoping that the threat will be removed/taken care of.  They have no idea that it makes being nice to their kid just a little bit harder  and if you told them  they would take it as further evidence that you are a threat to their child.

Those courses are really high stakes and not fun to teach. For science  that would be 9th grade Biology.  &#x200B;  After that  some percentage of the student body will go down a Pre-AP/Honors track of classes. For science  this will often be Pre-AP/Honors Chemistry  Pre-AP/Honors Physics  and some fourth AP/honors class depending on the student's interest.  &#x200B;  Another (often bigger  depending on school) percentage of the student body will not be going down this track. However  even though Texas has adopted an endorsement system where students can supposedly tailor their high school years to what they want and need  it is still in a school's best interest to have students get multiple endorsements  meaning schools want all students to take as many math/science classes as possible. Since not everyone is cut out for the Pre-AP/Honors track  they have to take *something*... For science  students will often take a ""regular""/non-Pre-AP/non-honors"" Chemistry or Physics or something else. At many school  that ""something else"" is regular-A&P or Environmental Systems. Unless the class is ""AP Environmental Science"" then there is a very good chance you're going to be the ""4th science credit"" teacher. What this can often mean  in practice  is that you'll have a room of mostly academic underachievers who need a credit. Your job is to teach them what bare minimum you can and make sure everyone passes.\*\*  &#x200B;  I've taught a similar class to seniors taking regular Precalculus. If you want to see a joke of a math class  sit in on one of those at a lot of schools. We barely covered basic trigonometry and a bit of algebra review over the course of a year.  &#x200B;  \*\*I don't mean to be Debby Downer here  but that is the reality in a lot of Texas schools. Maybe you're school will be different and you'll get to teach a lot of cool stuff.

59,thedan663,Having a hard time getting into High School History at the public school level. Is working at a charter a year or two worth it  or might it take too much of a toll on me?,Graduated in 2015 with Secondary and History. I'm in Chicago/suburbs and not willing to relocate at the moment. I taught English abroad in Thailand after graduating and have been subbing the past year. It's hard for me to find a job in the public schools  even CPS  with my lack of experience and subject matter. I even have a hard time in interviews because student teaching in 2015  teaching abroad  and subbing is akin to a first-year teacher separated from lesson planning and actual teaching in the US. A charter school really likes me and I'm anticipating an offer  but I'm a bit nervous because there's no union and I've heard work/life balance is very hard. It's longer hours  which I'm fine with to an extent  but it's important for me to have a life too. Pay is slightly less  but not much. The reputation isn't terrible  but long hours are the biggest con of the job that I hear  as well as admin that's a bit iffy. I've always wanted public  but this might be the foot in the door for me.  Also  right now  I'm pursing my LBS1 endorsement and will be eligible for emergency approval in September and fully endorsed before next school year. At that point  I've heard jobs are far more plentiful in SPED and I should have more choice to find a job in the public schools. But there's a chance I'd still be subbing next year  don't know how often schools open with SPED jobs during the year. Like I said  I'd be eligible by September  but schools need to sign off on the emergency form.  Is it worth it to go to a charter school for a year? I just worry a bit about my mental health  but I have to get a job at some point and it'd at least be something more than student teaching  teaching abroad  and subbing. It'd be a full year of full-time teaching. I'm sure I'm in better hands than the TfA grads who haven't ever been in a classroom  but I still worry a bit about the crazy hours and reputation the charter school has.  What would you advise? Is it worth it to do the charter school for a year or two before moving on to public schools?

60,JulietKilo_,What do you wish you knew before choosing a career in teaching?,TLDR: I've been the student in the chair. I've not seen school systems and common core from the teaching perspective. What did you wish you knew as you started your teaching career? Do you have any advice?   On mobile  so I apologize for formatting issues.   I graduated University in December from a STEM major. I went into college as a biology major  and have always considered teaching as an option. I ultimately chose my STEM degree (not biology  but a STEM field) because I was passionate hands-on science and application. I felt like I would be happier in my chosen career.   There's just one problem. I hardly use my science background. An analyzer does most of the work for me. I apply only a small fraction of the science I learned in my 4.5 years. I've searched the job market and I would definitely need to go back to school to find something I'm remotely ok with for the rest of my life (I'd have to get an MPH  but there are no promises I'd like the work)  This brings me back to teaching. I'd want to teach either 4th or 5th grade  or high school biology/earth&space. As this is something I've had in mind while in school  I don't think I'd be switching for the wrong reasons. I have a few ideas for how I'd like to run a classroom that I personally think are unique (at least none of my teachers in school did stuff like this). I've always had encouraging and passionate teachers that made me passionate about the future and I'd love to pass that on to future generations. I want to ensure that my potential students are LEARNING and not just testing well/going through the motions. I want to promote healthy study habits (I never studied in high school. First semester of college was tough because I didn't know how to study). I want to foster an environment that makes students excited to come to my class  allow them to grow personally and as future professionals. I know this is ambitious in a class of 25-30 students  but it's what I would want as a goal.   I'd be able to engage in the fundamentals of the science that I'm passionate about  and create exciting new ways to pass the information on.   Like any major career change  I'm nervous. I've been the student in the chair  I've not seen school systems and common core from the teaching perspective. What did you wish you knew as you started your teaching career?

71,acasey867390,Summer School Drama,This is my first summer teaching summer school and I was told that strange things often happen. I didn’t expect this type of strange. I was preparing for my second class of the day when a young man and who I thought was his mother  came into the classroom. Their English wasn’t very good but I gathered that they were looking to register him for an English class.  Now  this is the second week of classes so I was pretty sure registration was over and I was very confused as to why they were asking me and not the women in the front office whom they must have seen on their way into the building. I informed them that they would be able to discuss registration with the office and politely showed them out of the room since I had a class to teach.  Roughly 20 minutes later  the boy comes in again  this time alone and says he just registered. However  he didn’t have any paperwork with him. I had him sit at a desk and called the summer school coordinator. She grew very angry when I explained the situation and told me she would be right up. She arrives and orders him to leave and that he is trespassing. He refuses to leave and tries to give her the same spiel he gave me. She keeps telling him that he needs to leave  that he is not a student.  While this is going on I silently motioned to my 7 other students to follow me and I take them out of the classroom and put them in another classroom for their safety since it’s clear this guy is not supposed to be here. When I return the coordinator turns to me and tells me call the police. I stayed out in the hallway and do just that telling them we gave a trespasser who is refusing to leave.  It’s only when the police arrive I hear the story. Apparently this guy is 22 and thought he could just show up at a high school and sit in on English classes to improve his English since he just got here from China. The woman he was with earlier was his sister. When they were told he could not register he tried to stay and was told that if he came back he would be arrested for trespassing. Evidently sister left and he snuck back in and went to my English class.  The police escorted him from the building and informed him that if he returned he would be arrested and my students and I went back to analyzing Edgar Allan Poe’s “The Raven”.

I recently had the opportunity to film a conversation between two incredible souls  one a therapist I work with and the other a school teacher who is starting her first year as a principle this year. We are talking a lot about a time when Dawn  the educator  was in school and how the community helped her through difficult times. She also talks about the difficulty of teaching  and how people seem to have all kinds of misconceptions about what being a teacher requires of a person.  It's a longer conversation  about 55 minutes  but I hope that it is well worth it if you choose to watch the video. I hope that it can encourage you in some way!

Some of what I've seen divide it up by skill. Different stations for writing  reading  doing  analyzing data  etc. I've started by taking my favorite bits from different lessons and dividing it up to make stations. I also try to bring in applications from history  math  and lots of English (I'm a science teacher). I like to have several different levels of skills  from reading & answering basic questions on up. I want students to display basic knowledge  apply information  and create something of their own.   I try to make enough so there's more stations than groups  and let groups move around at their own pace. My stations usually take several days to complete.

I like working stations but it’s great introducing them from the beginning of the year. Make sure you have the directions down and be explicit about your assignment. Make sure you walk around and facilitate. What is the end goal? Make sure every student has a role.... however this can be tricky when you have ELD and IEP students. Hopefully you can direct roles for some of your top students. It’s not going to be perfect but you will get the hang of it.

I always had kids finishing early and kids who didn’t finish in time were upset. Instead I changed it to daily 5 with the stipulation that I would stop and do a quick gather/meeting/cleanup before starting the next rotation but there’s was flexibility for them to change in the time frame. So even though we stopped every 20 minutes  they could choose to go back to whatever center the next round if they wanted too  or they could change centers in the middle of each rotation.   The break every 20 minutes helped with control.

Primary teaching interests me purely because I wouldn’t have to specialise in a subject and can a teach a variety of subjects on the curriculum.

If you're not the personality type to set the bar for enthusiasm  it can be tough to keep their tiny little attention spans for long enough to help prepare them for life. You become a quasi-parent. They're more likely to laugh at your jokes and smile when you smile  but you gotta be able to put that on pretty much every single day. On the flip side  you're going to have kids whose main source of information/love/abuse/influence can vary wildly  even from week to week or day to day based on which parent or guardian they're staying with. They might not have eaten the night before and the morning of because they didn't change their little siblings diaper and they carry that with them in a very visible way. It can be very rewarding to show a kid that it won't always be that way and help them hopefully get on the path to becoming well adjusted  but sometimes  no matter how hard you try  you won't be able to get through to them.  If you like to stay focused on in depth material and finding interesting ways to explain and demonstrate materials  then you'll probably find more rewards in the secondary grades. Granted  there will be plenty of kids that aren't interested because it wouldn't be cool in front of their friends or because they hate you and your class by default. They carry issues from home with them as well  but  especially in high school  the parents tend to be less involved compared to the earlier years. You'll definitely spend more time on curriculum planning and classwork since curriculum at the earlier grades tends to be pretty comprehensive while you'll find the need to supplement the secondary curriculum with stuff you make or with supplemental materials. In Washington State of the USA  our teachers of grades 3-12 tend to get particularly scrutinized based on their students' performances on the state tests  so you'll want to make sure you're preparing the students by teaching them the content that aligns with the test and making sure they have the physical skills of keyboarding and using a mouse or track pad that they'll be using during the test.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.14413859852884245,32843,0.0

I can’t handle the neediness of elementary students or the energy of middle school. I relate well with older kids. But for others the idea of hanging out with teenagers all day is their personal hell and they love how cute  innocent  enthusiastic  etc the younger grades are.   How much you’ll need to specialize at each level can change based on so many factors (subjects you’re endorsed in  school needs  etc). The only time I taught elementary was a summer school/camp type thing. I taught ESOL Science so that was pretty specialized.

Fill your desk space with some cute little theme for you  and throw up some cute borders on the whiteboards and whatnot. But aside from that  try to let the things that go up on the walls be class-made.   Create an anchor chart that with their input that covers your rules and expectations on that first day of school--this will help them build up critical thinking and will help them later on when you're teaching them to be accountable.   Create an anchor chart with the class for each theme/topic that you teach and display them as you go  pulling some down as they become no longer necessary.   Have them help to create some charts for things like basic writing rules  math rules  etc. that you can post in a writing center or help area.   As little-kid as it sounds  have them create some art work or show off their classwork. 4th graders still love to have their hard work shown off. It helps them build pride and self-worth/self-respect and shows them that you are also proud of the work that they do. Dedicate a space to great work and have a space for every child  making sure every child always has a piece of work up and switching out for new work often--you can even allow the kids to switch out work on their own when they want to show something new off. Dedicate another space specifically to art and take some time once every couple of weeks to do a relevant craft with your kids. Science and social studies lend themselves well to crafts.

Do you have any other 4th grade teachers at your school that you will be working with?  I would start out by looking at/measuring classroom furniture and drawing up a map of the room.  Start thinking about books that you want to read outloud to your class (I read every day to my students.)  A good way to start the year is to read one book from a few different series at different levels to introduce kids to a variety of books.  Also  some kids that are lower readers will be more likely to read books at their level if you have read one to the class.  Henry and Mudge  Magic Treehouse  Cam Jansen  Diary of a Wimpy Kid are some good choices to start with.    Then for yourself I would suggest making a curriculum map for the year.  A grid with the subjects down the side and the months across the top  then figure out what you need to cover in each month to give yourself a picture of what the year looks like to help with planning.  This is something your team mates may already have.  Build some routines into your schedule to help students know what to expect and to help things run more smoothly.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.2553418803418803,32894,

Always drives me a little crazy to see 3rd-5th grade rooms totally devoid of child input and all about whatever sassy theme the teacher threw up on every visible surface.   In Kinder anchor charts are so fun. It only gets better as they go up in age and ability and are able to offer more and more input! They have such important things to say and class-created works like that are a super effective way to exercise some student-centered teaching. We also work a lot with vertical alignment of learning standards here (skills building on each other over each grade level  like K counting to 100  3rd learning multiplication  and 5th learning division) and I always found it fun to take a Kindergarten lesson and anchor chart and up the difficulty + update the theme to make it relevant and challenging for older kids. It made it less scary for me when I realized I could still teach them about stuff like dinosaurs in nearly the same exact way  just with some slightly different focus points and more expectations from them.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.1652777777777778,32895,

If it's bad enough that it is impacting your day to day life  then definitely address it. I'm no therapist but I would look at this two ways:  1. Figure out what the reasoning is behind your anxiety? Are you afraid about how the new job will be? Worried you won't be released from your current position? Feel bad leaving your current school? Think people will think poorly of you for leaving?  Once you figure that out  you can think about it rationally and address it.   2. While most people say to look on the brightside  it can sometimes be helpful to do the opposite. Consider your fear and ask ""what is the *worst* thing that could happen"" and follow that up with ""so what?""  That ""so what"" could mean thinking through how you would respond  figuring out if there would actually be any repercussions  or anything else you need it to mean.   Whatever happens  know that you recognized you were in a situation you didn't like  and you stepped up and changed it. Change brings uncertainty  not not changing would have left you miserable.

That falls to the custodial staff.  Heck  our custodial staff cleans everyone's rooms every summer anyway (as in moves all the furniture to one side of the classroom  scrubs the floor  then moves it to the other side and scrubs the rest)  so it's really not an issue here at all.  Have you tried talking to the custodial staff at your new school to see what they can do so that you don't have to?

I know  when I came in to start my first year of teaching  my classroom was a room they’d been using for storage for several years. There were boxes and shelves and tables piled full of stuff everywhere and no one knew where I should put any of it  nor did they know who would know. I ended up throwing a lot of stuff away and probably would’ve gotten into trouble if people had found out  but I asked and emailed and called and no one wanted any of it or could tell me what to do with it and I needed it out. 🤷🏻‍♀️   Later in my career  I was reassigned to a new room and  while it hadn’t been storage  the previous teacher in that room left it in a big mess. I feel like it’s just the norm. A teacher friend of mine was assigned to a new room for this coming year and I helped her move in to the new room and clean it out and it was in a similar state. Just a mess. And I know and like the teacher who left the room that way. She was always on top of things and seemed so organized  but when she left  she left all the stuff in there. Even when it’s not dirt and old papers and stuff  teachers just accumulate stuff. If I left my classroom right now  I’d probably leave a lot of stuff I’d think is useful because I use it and it would end up being stuff the new teacher just saw as clutter and didn’t want. Also  I don’t know how it is everywhere else  but at my school  it’s pretty hard to properly get rid of stuff you don’t want. We have to file a work order and submit a request to shred any old books  after getting approval to discard the old books. Why they can’t be donated to a school that might need them  I don’t know. I’ve been begging to throw out 17 old (huge) science kits taking up a lot of space in my classroom because they’re old  misaligned with current standards  and the stuff is either mostly gone or dry rotted. I only got approval to get rid of them this year. Finally!  That was long. Tl;dr - leaving a clean classroom is theoretically a beautiful idea and I wish it happened more. Realistically  though  there’s a lot of reasonable things that prevent it from happening.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.1311512131279573,32925,

The walls were also *brown* and *baby blue*  which in combination with the salmon colored cabinets  was a sight for sore eyes. The room itself wasn’t too dirty  at least.   Then they moved me into a hoarder’s room. I didn’t even realize it at first because I was blinded by the bright yellow and baby blue hallway that was half-covered in black chalkboard paint. Then the half blue  half yellow wall on the other side of the room distracted me. And once I got past that .... the junk  oh god  the junk. It was everywhere. Half-empty 20oz bottles of Diet Coke took up an entire cabinet. In the desk drawers were piles of hair ties and bobby pins  lipstick tubes  tissues with lipstick imprints  and a few handfuls of loose gummy bears. The other cabinets were filled with poorly copied worksheets and picture books from the 80s and 90s that were probably missing pages  I don’t know  I shoved them all into a box and threw them into the office so they could be someone else’s problem. There was probably an inch of dirt and foot covering the kid’s cubby area ... it was a disaster.

You will have the same delightful mix of interesting cool kids at this school as you would at any other school. I think the biggest generalization you could make is that probably many of the students speak Spanish at home and will also feel more comfortable speaking Spanish with each other at school. Have you participated in training about students who are bilingual? It's really important to know that if they speak their home language at school or during class THAT IS HELPFUL FOR THEIR LEARNING. I am a bilingual teacher at a title 1 school and some of the monolingual teachers assume that students are off task if they are speaking Spanish when usually they are actually using their home language to help themselves understand the content of the class. If you dont speak any Spanish I would start trying to learn at least something.

For the most part be yourself. Maintain a strong relationship with parents and things will go smoothly. The parents will have your back as long as you demonstrate you care. The difference between this population and others is that parents don’t always communicate well. There is usually a cultural and language barrier. Some of these kids come with serious baggage. Many come from tough backgrounds so you got to be empathetic to their needs. Most importantly  Never be friends! These kids think they can relate to you but they can also use it against you. Be firm and make sure you develop structure. Rules are everything with these students. Learn everything you can about their backgrounds. It makes a huge difference to know where they are from. Many are at risk youth and are from low poverty backgrounds. Just be safe and vigilant. Stay cool!  P.S.

They sometimes don’t make it to breakfast before school and are hungry until 1st recess when they can grab something.   All kids need routines and consistent expectations. Kids that act out are often the ones that need the most love. Stay calm and document.  Plan for brain breaks every hour. Kids and adults need to stretch  it can be a quick 3 minutes  but the more movement the better.  When posing a question to the class  have students tell their elbow partner their answer to build confidence in their responses.  If you have a class of English Learners always encourage  remind  and model writing/answering in complete sentences.  You will have a great year!

Well I find that many of my students parents who are immigrants obviously have taken huge risks just for their kids to get their education so even if they arent involved in the way we would expect I think that many them are incredibly dedicated to their kids education and it's our job as teachers to find ways to involve them that they can engage with.

Teachers who teach at predominantly Hispanic/Latino schools  what should I expect?  Edit: I want to clarify. I’m Mexican. Grew up in Mexico  and my first language was Spanish. I went to Title 1s all my life. I’m posting this because I’ve been seeing a lot of posts from first-year teachers who went into Title 1s and somehow ended up traumatized. I don’t remember kids being THAT bad when I was younger. That’s why I’m asking.,self,No video,2019-07-12 12:04:14,14.0,0.0,13.0,CTmassive,No problem!

I graduated in 2017 so my ST experience is still relatively fresh. Where I attended school  we were assigned two 1.5 month placements. I had one 8th grade and one 9th grade placement. A lot of your experience will be determined by the mentor teacher you are placed with. My first mentor teacher was awful  without going into detail  she shouldn’t have been working with adolescents... basically this impacted my experience there  it was very stressful and negative. I did my best just to complete my time and move on to the next one. My second mentor teacher was everything a teacher should be  and this is where I truly gained a positive experience. He supported my ideas  gave me insightful feedback  and helped me develop my skills.   Although my placements were SO different I did still learn from both of them. First placement taught me that you will have to work with uncooperative people sometimes  and you have to be creative to make the most of it. I set basic goals of “speak loudly and clearly” and “develop positive student relationships” and “become comfortable enforcing classroom rules.” These simple goals laid the groundwork for the second placement  where I was really able to flex my creative lesson planning and figure out what kind of teacher I was.   So even if you get stuck with less-than-helpful mentor  set basic goals for yourself and put all the skills you’ve been learning about into practice. Hopefully you will get two great mentors!   Other general advice: be engaged always. Give it 100% and SHOW that you are in it to win it  it’ll help you land a hella good reference letter.   Make connections! You’ll most likely be subbing after you graduate  so if you make a good impression on the other teachers and admins in that school you will likely be offered a job.   SAVE EVERYTHING! I’m talking lesson plans  student work samples****  everything! Not only will you need it for the edTPA  but for future job interviews as well.  Have fun with it- this is your chance to implement any ideas  strategies and games you have learned about during college. Find out what works and doesn’t work in a real classroom.   Hope this helps!  Edit: forgot to mention that the approach to your student teaching is really whatever your mentor decides it will be. They may expect you to take over the classroom on the second day  or they may ease you into it over the course of a week or two. Communication is key! Email/call if possible before the start of school. If that isn’t possible  on your first day have a sit-down and make a plan with them: what is their typical day like? What do they expect of you? Can you use any of their materials or do you need to start your unit from scratch? Be open with them about what you need- this is your learning experience!,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.19069954867827207,33032,0.0

I'm just going to give you a couple overviews because I did mine in Oklahoma and I had a nightmare scenario that you certainly won't deal with.  *Watch the first week and learn your mentor teacher's style.  *Learn every student's name and make sure they know you are trying to learn all their names. Students want to rebel against anyone they see as temporary. That's why subs get eaten alive.  * Be prepared EVERY DAY. If you are teaching know your shit. If the MT is teaching know the lesson so you can walk around the room and help.  *Be firm. Set expectations. However  be likeable. No kid has ever learned anything from a teacher they didn't like. That said  don't seem like you need them to like you. Just be an amplified version of the fun  passionate parts of you.  *Diversify: If there is a day when your teacher is doing something mundane like vocab we're showing a movie  ask if there is another teacher in the same content area that you can go and watch that day. Always pay attention to see what works and what doesn't.  *Finally  don't be upset if you suck at first. You will suck at first. We all suck at first. It's the love of teaching and kids and being a lifelong learner that pushes you through the wall. Teaching is a long hard road that takes years to get good at. But  you're drawn to it because you're a goddamn superhero. You are doing something others can't do. You won't fail because you won't allow yourself to fail. That's why you do what you do.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.09997023809523813,33033,

That said  student teaching is the natural culmination of studying education. If they're aware you're studying to be a teacher  they know this is happening sooner or later  and should be aware such a conversation is on the horizon.   Finally  employment should be mutually beneficial. You should not expect an employer to keep you around because they feel any loyalty to you. They won't. Similarly  you should not feel like you owe an employer loyalty when it isn't in your best interest. Be professional  but you're getting close to entering the professional world.

I survived  but it was ROUGH and I definitely burned the candle at both ends for four months. However  I didn’t have classes aside from student teaching seminar and one other class that I “independent studied” during the semester which helped.  I got a second credential in CA  student taught a full year although less than full time  and didn’t work at all aside from some subbing days here and there. I did have a full course load for the entire year  which took up a lot of time. A few of my friends worked and most of them ended up quitting their jobs at some point during the year. It was much easier the second time around not working  and I can’t imagine working and being a full time student and student teaching.  So  all this to say: If you can afford to and/or if you’re also taking a full courseload  I recommend not working - but if you  like me the first time  aren’t sure you’ll be able to pay your bills without your job it’s doable. I would just be sure to talk to your boss and make your hours/schedule/whatever very clear and make it known that student teaching is your priority.   Just wanted to give perspective from both sides!

I don't know where you're at located at present  but I'm pretty sure Northern Virginia would love to have you. 7+ years experience and a Masters will get you starting around $60k. We can't find enough people here with a population that is still exploding. My district's HR is always still actively hiring people literally during teacher work week before school starts  and this year several of the schools went with long term subs in the positions for the whole year.  One thing I might suggest is reaching out to the schools you've applied to  if the vacancies are still posted. If you can get ahold of the department chairs or supervising admin  even better to go through those people.  Have you also considered reaching out to your principal to let him know you're still looking and would appreciate any leads he might have? He might be a jackass  but if things are that sticky for you  appealing to any sense of power trip he might be on could be worth it if it helps pay the bills.

Between that and teaching in mainstream schools since then  I’ve had my fair share of threats of violence both directly and indirectly.  I wouldn’t say that I have PTSD from any of it  but I can certainly understand how that kind of shit could cause it in others.  The best thing you can do is whatever you need to do for yourself.  Teaching is a job.  It pays the bills (barely).  It is not a job that you need to sacrifice your physical  mental  and emotional well-being.  If it’s something that will cause you stress and anxiety constantly  I might suggest looking for other jobs  either now or in the future if things don’t start looking up.  I’m sorry that crap happened to you.  I hope that your new school will be much better for you.  Perhaps after having a few years in a good place will help you feel more at ease.  Since I’ve gotten away from the alternative school where I started  I’ve had great experiences with great kids (for the most part)  and has helped me get back to why I chose teaching.

I can’t believe how strong you are  going back to the classroom so quickly. You can go this!   I had a very bad second year  and was told everything was my fault with no support to fix the supposed problems. The thing that helped me the most was a mentor teacher. Basically  due to my previous years’ scores I was given a chance to have a mentor to come and observe me multiple times. Honestly  the meeting after the first observation fixed me. I was so nervous that I was still going to do everything ‘wrong’ that I wasn’t very effective.   I think the best way to alleviate symptoms is exposure therapy. Do any of your friends have school aged kids? You could visit with them and things would go well/as planned prior to the year starting. Also  talk to your principal or PLC coach.

Things got really bad when I lost admin support.  I left mid-year and moved over 1000 miles away to a rural town to accept a vacancy there.  I realized I had PTSD when I would get all worked up for the school day  cringe at bells  avoid admin  and this school is a dream environment so my fears make no sense.  It is slowly getting better  and I love my new school in Wyoming.  (We have positions open  so contact me if you want information.)  These are some things that I have found help:  1)  Stop drinking.  Not even on weekends.  Be completely present when you are not in the classroom.  2)  Only have positive teacher friends.  I know it is relieving to complain about kiddos and have a bitch fest about *that* kid  but it doesn't help in your classroom.  3)  Be a mentor.  Find someone who is struggling (I know  struggles in a rural school are laughable  but there is always a teacher that is crying during their planning time) and help them take control of their classroom.  4)  Redo your classroom.  You are reminded of your old school because you are still in a school.  Embrace alternative seating  turn off florescent lights and get lamps  put up homey window treatments  and utilize paintings instead of anchor charts (many libraries rent paintings).  5)  Reinvent your curriculum.  Take lots of field trips so you can see your kiddos outside of the classroom.  CHANGE EVERYTHING.  Your PTSD stems for lack of control  but you have the control back.  Your body just needs to catch up to that reality.  Give it time.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.00318181818181818,33126,

A lot of the stigma goes back to comparisons to the men who came back from WWI who were diagnosed with PTSD. The thing is  it's been an ongoing scandal ever since  outside of the public eye  that those men were diagnosed with PTSD  because they did NOT have PTSD. They were given that diagnosis to make the resultant symptoms sound MILDER so as not to put people off signing up to fight. Ie. it was ""stress""  rather than what it was: loss of apparent sanity from protracted periods of sleep deprivation  fear for one's life  bombardment with deafening explosions and being surrounded by mud  blood and corpses.   &#x200B;  Whole different kettle of fish  so if you're comparing yourself to them and telling yourself you couldn't have PTSD because you're not that bad  don't. They did not have PTSD  they had something far more severe that was downplayed as PTSD to save face for the government. What you have is PTSD.  &#x200B;  With that out of the way  no  you're not an idiot for having developed it  almost ANYONE would in your position. I wouldn't be able to handle it. It's actually amazing you lasted as long as you did. I'd have backed out ages before. Teaching in an environment like that takes a VERY specific kind of person who is simply either acclimatised to that level of stress  or is simply not prone to stress. There are very few people like that. I think the move to a quieter school was definitely for the best.   &#x200B;  So  now to deal with the stress and anxiety you still feel. Unfortunately  I'm not a psychiatrist  but I can offer you some tips:     1: What happens at school  stays at school. Outside of school hours  do not take correspondence from students  parents or colleagues unless it is VERY important. Do not give out contact details other than your work email or phone number  and turn off your work phone (if it's a mobile one) when you go home. Check your work email ONCE in the evening. If there are no urgent (and I mean URGENT) emails  leave it for tomorrow to read or respond to anything.   2: During the day  there are medications that can help lower your stress levels that aren't of the industrial strength you might imagine. Beta blockers  for example  you can pretty much take like candy (within reason lol)  and they will lower your blood pressure. My absolute guardian angel for panic during the teaching day is diazepam (valium)  but be very careful with it and consult your physician before even considering taking it. Benzodiazepines are EXTREMELY effective for anxiety  but they are SO effective that they are very addictive. Don't take the advice of some bozo on the internet like me and start taking it all gung-ho  see your doctor about it and ask whether they think it would be appropriate for you. For me  just carrying it calms me down. I think I've taken it maybe twice in the past year. I would also ask your doctor about a medication called fluanxol (not sure whether that's a brand name)  but it's a non addictive alternative to benzodiazepines for anxiety. For day to day stuff  talk to your doctor about maybe going on an SNRI such as venlafaxine (Effexor) or similar  or a tricyclic such as amitriptyline. Again  don't take medical advice from randoms on the internet  see your doctor and discuss any medications before doing anything.    3: You may well not even need any medication! Therapy such as CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy) has been highly successful for many people with elevated stress or anxiety  and is widely available from accredited practitioners. I know there's a stigma around going to therapy  but you'd be surprised how many people do  even if they dip in and out. Hell  sometimes I book one session with our university therapist just to go sit in there with them and cry for an hour lol.  4: CRY! If you are stressed or anxious  you may well want to cry. Don't resist it! Try to keep it out of class if you can  but hey  nobody is a machine. If you get home and feel like crying  do it! There's a reason your body is trying to make you do it - it makes you feel better! It's literally a release valve for strong emotion.  5: BREATHE! Breathing is one of the first things to go when you're stressed or anxious  and it's what drives the negative feedback spiral that kicks off a panic attack. When you're stressed  your breathing becomes very shallow  and you might not even notice it  but the lack of oxygen to your brain (hypoxia) will quickly make you feel dizzy and confused  which in turn makes you more alarmed  making your breathing speed up. However  what usually happens is you end up taking very fast  shallow breaths (hyperventilation). This will quickly spike the oxygen levels in your system. You would think this would be a good thing  but it's very much not. Oxygen surplus leads from hyperventilation leads to oxygen intoxication  which will make you feel... well  dizzy and confused (aren't our weird little bodies fun? XD). So now you're dizzy and confused  AND you've suddenly noticed you're breathing out of control. Congratulations  you're probably sweating bullets now  and well into a full blown panic attack. Let's deal with that. Take control. Your body has pulled its own fire alarm  and you need to reset it. Sit down  take DEEP breaths in through your nose (1... 2... 3... 4...) and then out through your mouth (1... 2... 3... 4...)  if hyperventilation continues  just start over. In... out... until your breathing stabilizes. There are actually free phone lines you can call that will put you through to a recording that will just talk to you and guide you through this breathing exercise. Once your breathing is stable  the dizziness will subside  and you can take further steps to lower your stress levels.  6: Tell a friend or loved one what you are going through. Having support close by is invaluable. People are far more understanding than you might think. They won't think you're crazy or being dramatic  I promise you.  7: Read some good support books. Not the crappy ""self help"" books by self professed gurus that promise to change your life  REAL books by people just relating their own experiences and advice on how they deal with anxiety and stress. Sometimes just reading about someone else's experiences and realizing they're similar to yours and you're NOT crazy can be a colossal help. One that springs to mind for me is a book called ""How To Survive The End Of The World (When It's In Your Own Head)"" by a chap called Aaron Gillies. I can highly recommend it if you can track down a copy. He just talks about his experiences with anxiety  how he coped  and how he finally learned to live with it and rebuild his life. It's never preachy  in fact  it's very humble.      8: Join a community. You're already in one here  but there are plenty more that are specific to anxiety and PTSD right here on Reddit AND in real life. Get involved with them and just... talk. And listen  of course. There are millions of people out there with the same problems who are ready to help you  you just have to reach out.        Outside of that... Let's see... Positive stories about my classes? There's the time I gave a lecture to 200 grad students while having a full blown panic attack lol I had to lean on the lectern the whole time  but I went the distance for two hours and delivered the lecture. I thought they were going to walk out thinking I was insane haha. I actually got several positive reviews for how astute  informative and entertaining I was  far more than any other lecture I've given lol ...I just wish I could remember what I said! I was zoned out the whole time in a panic XD Now I begin every lecture by reminding myself that ""this is not the greatest lecture in the world  this is just a tribute"" haha     Hope some of my rambling is of use to you.     All the best. You're gonna win.",,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.1471155472132034,33132,

I broke up a fight between students and got mildly hurt in the process; had to evacuate my class.  I had a parent come in screaming at me and humiliating me in the front office with every swear word imaginable and told me she wasn't afraid of going back to jail to protect her kid (basically threatening me) because I took her child's cellphone for using it in class.  I had a student draw all over my personal belongings and try to sharpen a pointer stick into a weapon.  I had sexual slurs said about me and to me by my students.  Students would hide under the tables and scream ""no"" at me for a bunch of reasons.  There was little support from my principal or my district--other teachers are the only reason I made it through that year.  A teenage sibling of a student attending our school actually brought a dead baby in a stroller to the front office my first year.

The charter school has zero discipline.  The kids were able to do whatever they wanted  behave any way they felt.  They run the school.  Admin has their hands tied. The higher ups do not allow principal to expel  they will lose money.  I had a student chase me in my classroom and cuss me out because I asked him to leave for disruption  again.  He went home for a day. A day. I was told it was my fault that it escalated.  I felt I was going to have a heart attack most days.  Thank goodness I found a position within the main ISD this upcoming year. A school with support and discipline policies.

The thing with soldiers in WWI is we really don't know what precisely was wrong with them  although we sure as shit know WHY. It used to be called ""shellshock""  but it was really more than shock  it was disabling mental trauma that likely couldn't be treated within a person's lifetime. All we can really be sure of is they just... broke. Irreparably.  Good news is  you are not irreparable  and not even broken  you just need the right treatment to help you keep the anxiety at bay when it strikes. Your past trauma is haunting you  but that can be dealt with. People like to call these things ""demons""  and I like that metaphor. It's helpful sometimes to picture your fears as a physical being that creeps up on you and takes a hold of you. Why do I like that metaphor? Because if it's a physical being that lives inside you  you can learn to beat it. Not only that  but every time you beat it  it gets smaller and weaker. I like the quote from Kill Bill about beating enemies that Pai Mei gives: ""What happens when your enemy is three inches away from you? Do you curl up in a ball? Or put your fist through them?"". We're not talking a human enemy here  and it's a lot closer than three inches  but you can still learn to put your fist through it when you picture it as a physical being (disclaimer: do not punch yourself XD).  The whole arsenal of things at your disposal  therapy  breathing  feeling your feelings  medication  reading  learning  whatever it takes are what enable you to do that. It's a tough road  but it's one worth walking :)  &#x200B;  Let me know how you like the book. It did a huge amount for me.  &#x200B;  Edit: Don't know if you're into poetry  but here's one of my favourites on the topic of courage and perseverance. You may already know it; ""If"" by Rudyard Kipling. It was written for his son  hence why he addresses the reader as a man (I don't know whether you're a man or a woman)  but it applies to either gender: [https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46473/if---](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46473/if---)",,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.09218559218559218,33153,

Most teachers' situations aren't like mine (I think).    Basically  I taught for 2 years in 5th grade at an elementary school in a bad neighborhood.  The students were so disrespectful.  I broke up a fight between students and got mildly hurt in the process; had to evacuate my class.  I had a parent come in screaming at me and humiliating me in the front office with every swear word imaginable and told me she wasn't afraid of going back to jail to protect her kid (basically threatening me) because I took her child's cellphone for using it in class.  I had a student draw all over my personal belongings and try to sharpen a pointer stick into a weapon.  I had sexual slurs said about me and to me by my students.  Students would hide under the tables and scream ""no"" at me for a bunch of reasons.  There was little support from my principal or my district--other teachers are the only reason I made it through that year.  A teenage sibling of a student attending our school actually brought a dead baby in a stroller to the front office my first year.

I don’t have noon ideas  but a little advice that may or may not be obvious. Be prepared. Don’t put things off until they absolutely have to be done  get ahead on things.   Also  instead of waiting to grade tests as soon as everyone is finished  grade them as they turn them in so that you don’t have as much or any at all at the end of the day.   Another thing  remain calm at all times. As soon as you start yelling and getting upset is the second when the students take control and silly as it sounds. Always keep a level head and never take anything personally. After each “situation” with every student  wipe the slate clean and don’t hold it against them.

You will build your classroom with your students. :)   Back to your question on books  many teachers will probably be giving away some books during your in-service week! I stocked two bookshelves my first year this way. If you still don't have enough try goodwill  library sales  and even craigslist will help fill your library. I recommend getting some tubs and organizing by genre. Also  make sure you have a good stock of multicultural books  high-interest/ low reading level books  and graphic novels.

I have been working in marketing for 3 years now and absolutely hate it. I have been wanting to return to college to become a teacher for the last two years and finally have decided I am going to take the leap and start my journey to become a teacher.

I cried every single day. Then  a teacher in the same grade pulled me aside asking if I was ok about halfway through my placement. I broke down to her and she encouraged me to be proactive by reaching out to my advisor. This teacher actually knew my advisor and offered to call her and explain what she had witnessed. I accepted and scheduled an appointment with my advisor for the following day. My advisor just told me to try and push myself and please my CT. During the last month of my student teaching  my CT contacted the director of ed at my university requesting an action plan for the rest of my ST.

It almost deterred me from teaching because she made me feel so incompetent. I dreaded going to school every single day because of the way she treated me. I never once complained to my university supervisor but we all met together at the end to discuss my progress  and my cooperating teacher proceeded to talk about how it was impossible for me to receive proficient scores in any areas because of how young I was. She also boasted about making me re-do a worksheet multiple times because it wasn't good enough (not helping or guiding me in the right direction  of course  since that wouldn't teach me anything). I walked out with my supervisor silently  and she told me she was never going to place another student teacher with that teacher again.   Luckily  since my field is special education  I was required to do another semester of student teaching in a primary setting. I was so nervous because of my first experience and it ended up being amazing. My cooperating teacher treated me like a professional and we truly worked collaboratively in the classroom. I am now entering my 6th year teaching and although it has its challenges  I love my job and I cannot see myself doing anything else.   I'm sorry you had such a gross experience but you are going to make a wonderful teacher despite it.

All my other friends who were student teaching had such great relationships with their teacher and I of course got the short stick. I'm not sure what he said to the principal but they didn't even try to interview me even though I am dual certified and they had a lot of positions open (and still do!). I remember one day he just railed on me and made me cry so hard I had to leave the room for the whole planning period and went to another teacher's room to calm down. Come to find out  he also made a bunch of other teachers and students cry before. My advisor was supervising me that day as well  and the teacher whose room I went to talked to him and told him that my CT was an a-hole and he should do something about. After that  I got a spiel about how I shouldn't gossip about other teachers because I need to suck ass to my CT for a recommendation. It really pissed me off that my future career was going to be based off of his recommendation. Not sure if I am being superstitious  but I almost felt as if I was blacklisted in that school district.

I’m not just saying that cause I married him. We used to tutor AVID together and I used to watch him teach lessons to the kids who truly had no idea what in tarnation was happening. He has this way with math and explaining it that’s amazing. Even the AVID teachers were impressed and amazed. It’s been 3 years since we tutored and the teachers still lament losing him.   I say this because during student teaching his first teacher hated him!! She didn’t want a student teacher and She was mad he wouldn’t be a free AVID tutor to her AVID classes  that he wouldn’t stay an hour after school everyday (we were told not to by our advisor at our university and we had a 2 month old baby and I couldn’t drive) she would make him come in way before her math classes for the day  and would ignore him  refuse to lesson plan except the last 5 or 10 minutes of her prep period and then would bad mouth him to his Supervisor saying he was uncooperative and uninvolved. Finally  she told him don’t come back after winter break. So they gave him another placement and it was amazing how quickly his reviews changed.

We aim to connect high school or college students willing to tutor other students for community service (which helps tremendously for college admissions)  in an affordable and accessible way. All tutoring is done online  and the one-time fee is $5 for unlimited access to service hours and tutoring if you need academic support. We want to change the way tutoring is done  since it is both expensive and inconvenient. We really hope you check us out at [teenteach.education](https://teenteach.education) and perhaps recommend this to your students  it really is a useful opportunity for students!

I can recommend it. It definitely had *some* high tier schools  but most were more mid/lower tier (or start-up schools). My understanding is that the Iowa fair is more for recent grads with minimal experience.   &#x200B;  With your experience  I would go to one of the Search Associates fairs. Search Associates has the highest tier schools. It's very competitive  but with your experience and licensure areas you can be picky with where you go- lots of schools will want you. Be aware that international school contracts are *two years*  not one year. Hope this helps.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.2623076923076923,33266,

Recruiting for the coming year began last January and should largely be over.  International schools recruit much earlier than stateside schools partially to avoid the added recruiting competition from local schools but primarily because most people need time to pack up and to move abroad.    I am a product of the international schools (Ghana  Thailand  and El Salvador. As an adult I attended two ISS job fairs and wound up first in Saudi Arabia and then in Beirut  Lebanon. I am told that Search Associates is now much larger than ISS. The UNI job fair was held late January through early February.  Teaching abroad is a great way to see the world. Since most countries are smaller than the U.S. and are geographically closer  it's easy to spend weekends abroad. Better  yet are the extended holidays for Spring Break and Christmas.   During my last teaching assignment abroad  I spent Christmas on an Egyptian paddle steamer and cruised down the Nile. I spent Spring Break touring Syria.   All told  I've spent 17 years abroad. As much as I enjoyed the expat life  I'm glad to be stateside and am happier yet to own my own home and to no longer have to live in furnished faculty apartments.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.1852633477633477,33272,

I've been teaching engineering and AP Computer Science in two public high schools for the last ten years.  I'm taking a year off to travel the world  chill out  and sniff around for possible teaching positions for 2020-21.  Have any of you gone to the Iowa or Atlanta international teaching job fairs?

547,danimarie82,Demo Lesson for a 12:1:4 Preschool class,I had an interview at a Special Ed. preschool at the end of June. It seemed to go pretty well and the interviewer (the head of the preschool program) said that they would be calling back once the summer session began to set up demo lessons. From my understanding  it seems like everyone who was interviewed will be asked to do a lesson  but I'm not positive. I was on vacation for the past week so if they do call me  it will be in the next day or so. Either way  I am looking for some guidance so that I will be more prepared.  I am certified Birth- 6th grade in New York  but B-2 and 1-6 are two separate certs and my 1-6 expired. The only requirement I have left to get my professional certifications is one more year of full time teaching experience  but now I have to get that under my B-2 which gives me less options.   So I interviewed at the preschool and if the demo lesson happens  it will be in a 12:1:4 class of children with mixed abilities (CP  LD  Autism). I was told that I can pretty much do anything...a gross motor activity  art activity  literacy activity  etc. I have done demo lessons before but they were older children and for whatever reason  they didn't stress me out as much. I worked in nursery schools for 3 years when I was in college  but for some reason I am drawing a blank on where to begin with this scenario. For the past 5 years I have been working as a TA in a K-2 autism class so I have experience with that population as well.   The woman said they would be telling us the theme for the week and a little info on the class when they call to set everything up. I know that I am probably overthinking this  but does anyone have any advice?

I am not sure about your program but when I was in college we had in person classroom experiences each semester.  Classes are great for some teaching strategies and advise  but it's different using it in a classroom in comparison to just talking about it!  The best advise I got was to pick the brain of my supervising teachers when I was in the classroom.   &#x200B;  I think you can get a job where you grew up  if that is what you want. I personally taught my first two years on the west coast to get experience and then came home afterwards. It depends how open you are to moving and what you are used to.

It is definitely realistic to get a job teaching at the school where you grew up  but it depends on teacher turn over among other things.  You can definitely make it your goal!  You might also ask your student teaching coordinator if it would be possible to student teach there  if it's close to Montevallo.    &#x200B;  You will probably need an Alabama teaching license; I don't know how it works there  but your university should help you get all the things you need to become certified.  In Utah where I am  you need to take a few tests  background check  and pay a fee.  It's not too tricky.   &#x200B;  My best advice?  Read ""The Classroom Management Book"" by Harry Wong.  My university didn't do a very good job at teaching classroom management.  They mostly taught cutesy pinterest things instead of the meaty stuff.  If you can't manage your kids  you can't teach them all the cool things they need to learn.  I wish I had that book for my wild first year!  &#x200B;  You'll do great!

Be prepared to discuss your approach to lesson planning + backward design -1.a) and how you differentiate instruction for diverse learning needs 1.b) and how you formatively and summatively assess student gains towards mastery 1.c) and how that data informs your next lesson/unit  etc.  2. Be prepared to talk about your goals/educational passions (something in the vein of “ideal unit you’d love to teach” or “an interdisciplinary unit you would be excited to collaborate on”   3. Be prepared to discuss parent and family communication (tip: the key to excellent communication is being proactive; not reactive. Don’t wait for things to get worse  to reach out. DO update parents with positive success stories  changes in mood or behavior  drop off in work quality  etc.)   4. Be prepared to discuss your state standards  have a few big ones that you’d be ready to name drop off the top of your head. Note: you don’t have to memorize the code name (like RL5.4-b) but DO be able to say something like  “since 5th grader’s in this state need to read a variety of text types around a common theme  I’d really love to develop a book club unit where blah blah blah great idea goes here blah blah.”  5. Make it about the kids. You love working with kids. That is the #1 best part of the job. I have seen wonderfully qualified candidates not get the gig because they only talked shop and forgot to make it about the most important person in the classroom; your clientele.   6. Classroom management may come up. This is the part where you bring it back to KNOWING your kids  and being consistent. Routines  communication  and planning proactively eliminate most classroom management issues  but if they do come up: know the kid who is in front of you  come from a place of compassion  but be firm. Keep your promises. Follow up with other staff  and/or the family.  7. Questions about going to other staff members for help might come up. This is not a trap- seeking help and communicating with more veteran staff who know the community is what smart teachers do. You want to be a part of the school community.  8. Speak from experience when you can 9. Speak from your creative hopes and passion when you can’t 10. Never bad mouth anybody at all whatsoever 11. Don’t apologize for what you don’t know  you too are a life long learner. Be excited by any opportunity to learn a new thing.  Good luck!,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.2805590750712701,33339,0.433

Ask questions! Ask what their team is like  ask about planning/collaboration (and be excited about it) and find natural places you could fit in. An example  I love making anchor charts and my teammate hates it so she makes all our copies and I make our anchor charts. I’m more creative so I make our team newsletter and have it to everyone early enough to get sent out weekly. I’m weirdly good at leading Simon Says so if my teammate has to step out to deal with a behavior issue or office emergency  I’m comfortable having 55 kids for a bit and keeping things together. Things like that. Giving anecdotes  real life examples of how you work in a team and how vital teamwork is for you.   Most likely the team just wants to see if you will fit in their groove.

610,PeterBird,Help - I just got hired for a high school science position without my license or a degree in science.,So I’ve worked at a public high school for the past two years as a paraeducator in the Life Skills classroom. Next year I was planning on leaving the position to get my MAT  license  and endorsement in English Language Arts (which is what I studied as an undergrad). However  near the end of the school year a science position became available and I put in an application. I knew it was a long shot as a I don’t yet have my license or an academic background in science but I love the school and the community and wanted to give it a shot. I felt that at the very least maybe I’d get an interview which would be valuable experience for later job hunting.  Flash forward to last week and lo and behold they offered me the job and I accepted. I’ll be teaching two sections of Biology  two of Computer Applications  one of Physical Science  as well as a mystery class they have yet to inform me of.  I’m a science enthusiast but with no formal academic background in these subjects I’ll definitely be doing quite a bit of review this summer and throughout the school year. I’ll also be in school on my own (most likely online)  working towards my masters as well as the necessary endorsements. With a restricted license I’ll have three years to complete my degree  earn my license and pass the NES endorsement tests.  I have a great support system in place but I also know this year is going to be very very busy and equally challenging. I’d love to hear any advice  tips  encouragement you all might have for me as I move into this position. I’d love to hear from folks who have earned their credentials while teaching full time (What programs did you use? What did/didn’t you like about them? How did you manage your time?). I’d also love to hear from those of you who have taught subjects outside of your academic background. Thanks in advance.

First of all  if you are in a state anything like AZ  science and math teaching jobs are basically guaranteed. If you apply  you basically get the job because there are so little applicants. (Edit: I just re-read this; don’t mean this to sound condescending. Just wanted to warn you to be careful when you apply for these positions bc you will probably get hired  lol. Make sure you really want it  which it sounds like you do! So great!)  Second of all  although I believe that doing your teaching cert/masters and working at the same time is totally doable (I’m currently doing this and my husband did this before)  what admin is already doing to you is pretty... cruel. They gave you FOUR preps. This means lesson planning for FOUR DIFFERENT classes all WHILE working on your certification. My husband had to do this his last year of teaching and it was ultimately what made him leave the school.   I don’t mean to scare you  but be really ready for the workload. I totally believe that you can do this with a lot of support from your colleagues and admin. Ask if they have a curriculum in place for each of the classes you are teaching. If you have to build your curriculum from scratch (like my husband had to)  all I can say is good luck!  (I don’t mean to sound negative btw. Just speaking from experience bc this happened to my husband before.),,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.096,33350,0.118

I worked at a charter for four years. The philosophy of the school was excellent and aligned with what I wanted to do: teach low SES students in a tough neighborhood. I ultimately quit and got into the public system because there were no accountability for the students. We never enforced deadlines on the students. Students were coming in once a month. If students failed  and that was on us. Our bosses yelled at us and humiliated some of us. I could really sense the trend in ""selling a product"" to other schools under the guise of giving quality education to all.  On top of that  our boss opened a second school (very common in charter world)  and pulled most qualified members of my school to work at that school  so now we have two failing schools. I constantly saw people quit  and people quit within the first two weeks of school  and I saw quality teachers getting fired because their need to hold students accountable didn't align with our school's philosophy. And because teachers quit all the time  students were used to not being taught at all. I saw great injustice done to our low SES students in my school ironically. Because we often didn't have a staff or two every year  we would hire last minute incompetent/questionable druggie teachers.. On top of that  we would just pluck office staffs to be teaching interns  my profession was completely undermined by people who have no background in teaching.  Oh and get this  we had to stay at the school until 4pm everyday and professional development meetings were no help to us all (we once hired an incoherent french dude who tried to inspire us  but instead got into fights with staffs during PD). There is absolutely a poor work-life balance  poor management  and lack of support. Be very cautious when selecting a charter school to work for and be extra picky. There is a reason that most charter schools have a complete revolving door of teachers and target young  vulnerable  insecure teachers.",,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.03894097222222223,33359,0.0

Here is what it has to say about decimals:   6. Use decimal notation for fractions with denominators 10 or 100. For example  rewrite 0.62 as 62/100; describe a length as 0.62 meters; locate 0.62 on a number line diagram.  7. Compare two decimals to hundredths by reasoning about their size. Recognize that comparisons are valid only when the two decimals refer to the same whole. Record the results of comparisons with the symbols >  =  or <  and justify the conclusions  e.g.  by using the number line or another visual model. CA   So  4th Graders aren't expected to really do any arithmetic with decimals. Decimals really get introduced in 5th grade...

Maybe have them do six adjectives and chose one to expand on  then have them also focus on the organization of the paragraph (topic sentence  support  etc).

This is a private school that said their 7th grade curriculum involves reading books like ""Dr Jekyll""  ""Anne Frank"" and ""Of Mice and Men"". I have taught 7th grade before but at a low level public school. I am trying to figure out what to teach. I have a couple of ideas. The first is to teach an adjective lesson where I give the kids an alphabet and make them write one adjective about themselves for each letter. Then they write six paragraphs about themselves using these adjectives. I have taught this before and it was done fine. I am afraid that this is too low level though. My other idea is to teach poetry. I have done these before as well. I want to teach my students how to write a sestina and will model part of it with them. I have also thought of teaching them black out poetry or a textual intervention. I am worried though that this is more unpredictable and student might not get it as much.

Students would need to engage with the 5 senses to show rather than tell where a character is and what they might be doing. This way you could introduce the 5 senses and test their knowledge of these and brainstorm ways to show where a character is without explicitly stating it. Following this  you can randomly assign students a setting that they then need to use the 5 senses to create across at least a paragraph. Then swapping with a partner and seeing if they can guess where the other student has attempted to describe. I like to give them really odd or unexpected settings like the side of a busy highway or the middle of a crowded shopping centre. That way they can start to tap in to characterisation as well  considering how the setting may make the character feel.  Good luck with what you choose to do!,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",-0.001666666666666683,33468,

Most states will have 1-2 main ones: a state university system and a university of ___ system.  For example  Tennessee has the University of Tennessee system and also the Tennessee Board of Regents system  with public universities belonging to one or the other.  There may also be other systems to govern community colleges  trade schools  professional schools  etc.  Generally  these systems will be run by a board that sets some overall policies regarding discipline  academics  finances  personnel  etc.  The universities will be run by their own administrations  but they are subject  to the policies put in place by the system.  Think of the system as state government and the university administration as local government.  When it comes to private universities  “university system” can basically mean whatever the schools in the system want it to mean.  It could mean they’re going to merge with another university or group of universities  similar to a corporate merger  or it could simply mean some kind of loose affiliation for accreditation or administrative purposes.  I don’t know how joining a system would bail a school out of debt because schools generally won’t want to just turn over their money to a struggling new member  but it may help make the school run more efficiently by sharing resources and allowing them to cut some administrators and personnel.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.03171095571095571,33475,0.15

The mechanism for projecting your voice seems to be the same as singing. I learned to speak loudly as a swimming coach as a teenager. There would be so much noise at the pool you had to be really loud to be heard. It translated well into teaching. I layer took singing lessons and hadn't realized that if been doing some of the technique already.  From my own experience  you need to move a lot more air than in normal talking. To do this you need to breath from your diaphragm to fill your lungs with lots of air. You could practice with a friend at a field and try to speak to them from further and further distances. It takes a bit of practice but it's not particularly difficult.   I usually feel my diaphragm tighten up a lot when I'm doing it to add more ""pressure"" on my vocal cords  if that makes sense. I'm a bit worried that I'm not explaining it properly and you'll bend up hurting your voice. If anything doesn't feel right or your voice gets raspy  you should stop.

A little scattered for now  but I taught in a Title 1 ELAR classroom for the past 5 years. Finding things that are relevant and interesting is key. Also  I used read alouds in my classroom where every T/TR I would read a book aloud to the class for 5-10 minutes. Depending on the class and their interests and desires  sometimes it would be the same book (I read the entirety of *Long Way Down* by Jason Reynolds to two of my classes over the course of a semester. Many begged me to keep reading.) I've also had success reading aloud Speak to 9th graders. Read alouds and shared reading were key for getting them invested and interested. I did *The House On Mango Street* with 9th as well.  I'm not sure how you feel about ""cussing"" or more mature content but once I realized that was holding me back from sharing some literature with my students  doors opened. Of course we discussed norms etc.   For some of my teen girls  recommending things like *The Poet X* by Elizabeth Acevedo or *I Am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter* by Erika L. Sánchez were amazing. I had a kid who thought there was no way I'd ever relate to his niche interests and obscure music. Found out he likes darker things and so I recommended *Conquest* to him by Jennifer Ridyard and John Connolly because when I read it I was surprised that there were heads being blown off in the first chapter. He ended up reading the whole series.   Not every kid has a success story  and most don't. But the few that do... I'm so glad! once I found their niche I was better able to help them. Or ask someone else who could. Another thing I would do is book talks. I would just share with them books I was reading  whether I had finished or not (once a student of mine asked to borrow the book I was reading and I couldn't say no even though I had just started it!) and I always tried to be honest about my own preferences  strengths and weaknesses as a reader. For example  reading YA lit is super easy for me and fun. Reading nonfiction is much harder for me. And I still haven't finished Seabiscuit and that's okay.

I often ask students which shows/movies they like and why to help me get an idea of books that they may like.  Our school librarian sets up ""book tastings"" in the library.  When the class comes in they find a bunch of tables covered in white table cloths with a small vase of fake flowers in the center.  On each table there is a pile of 7-10 books and paper for ""tasting notes"".  Students select a book to read for 10 minutes (they can switch through the books on the table if they need to).  They then jot down the title(s) they tasted and a few notes.  They are encouraged to quietly share their notes with those at their table  but shouting out to other tables is discouraged in this ""fine reading establishment"".  Repeat at another table.  It's a great way to have students select titles for independent reading.

More practical  real-world strands of maths (measurement  statistics  graph theory  financial maths  etc). Our general curriculum allows students to take their summary book of notes into every test/exam. I strictly emphasise the importance of students taking HANDWRITTEN notes and keeping up to date with mine\* for the explicit purpose of improving their memory. Even though students always have access to the book in tests/exams  memory work is a big deal for me as they do not have time to consult their summary book for every question during assessment. I aim for them to have memorised at least 90% of the content by test day.  \*I write handwritten notes using Notability on my iPad that I  personally  would put into my summary book if I were a student in their position. I would like to think that my notes are fairly easy to understand  highly succinct and overflowing with worked examples. I only take 'deep' notes (a lot of arrows  linking concepts  making connections  drawing my own diagrams  coming up with my own acronyms for things  etc) and encourage my students to do this also. My notes get posted on our class unit outline (a google doc with links for each lesson's content/class tasks/due dates/assessment dates). Students who are absent are required to catch up/keep up to date with their work using the outline.  I do usually spend the first 15 minutes of each lesson  writing my handwritten notes on the board  annotating and discussing them  before going through examples with the class. This is when 50% of the class get their notes done. The other 50% do them in their own time before class so that they can have the full lesson to complete their task questions/ask clarifying questions regarding anything they didn't understand when they read/took notes. Ideally the whole class would do this but I'm slowly working at improving overall work ethic in the class. It's a lot better than it was at the start of the year (thank god!) but they have a long way to go. My students are very laid back (which I love...I just need them to put their heads down and work harder...). Overall  this system works fairly well. I've tried a few different things over the course of the year (am now 6 months into my first year teaching math...and teaching in general...and so far so good!) This is what works best for my classes.  I should add: I also screen-and-voice record explanations for my deep/handwritten notes on my iPad as I'm writing them. I also post these on the unit outline (specifically for kids who are absent but also for those who need further clarification in their own time). When I'm away for whatever reason  students use these videos to take notes/see worked examples  etc. With already motivated  hard-working students  I feel like this method would be highly effective but hey  we can only teach the kids who show up to our classes every day.

I tell my students to follow the instruction or example and not copy it down during instruction  unless instructed otherwise. If they want to copy anything that I wrote  they should do it after the instruction is over. The reasoning is that weaker students tend to just copy everything I write down. They can't follow my instruction while doing the copying  so they end up with notes but no clue on how we got there. Task switching (a.k.a. 'multitasking') is not something humans are good at and it results in multiple tasks done poorly  especially while learning the tasks that are being switched.  Three important points about this:  * As last part of my instruction  I usually let my students complete a question that the should copy down from the board  and I will work it out so they can check their answer. * I usually don't erase anything from the board during instruction so students actually have the chance to copy something after the instruction is over if they want to. * The instruction is also in the book  along with a worked example.

As a small (formative) grade in the class  at least twice a semester depending on the class size  each student is randomly selected to take the class minutes like in an official meeting of sorts. They copy the objectives for the day  include a brief overview of what the lesson entailed  and then give their own remarks about how the lesson went in general  or they could share some other related anecdote.   Since it was English  I also had them recite a quote or poem (not memorized but of their choosing) to close  then the class ""votes"" to approve the minutes. If the mins are not approved by a majority  the kid gets a redo. (Or you could do a zero on the assignment  10 min lunch detention  etc). In a math class  I could see you having that student work a problem from the homework in front of the class  or discuss a mathematician they found who did something interesting.   This could include a copy of the notes taken in class if you wanted  and then could be scanned/digitized and put on a class page or LMS folder for other students to access when they're absent.   As far as HOW  I think you stress when you think they should take notes  and model how you think they could or should be done. I don't personally believe there is a one-fits-all notetaking style  but you may have a setup you think is best. By the time they get to high school  if they don't like your system  it's on them to attempt it your way and they can always go home and reformat them in a way they prefer.   Digitizing your notes is also helpful in general when your students are out for any period of time or on Home Bound  etc. You can always select a kid who does a really great job and ask to photocopy them so you don't have to do it.",,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.11529411764705882,33530,

You can teach them how to do it all day long. You can stop class  model  suggest  hint  demonstrate  everything you want. At the end of the day they won’t do it unless it’s graded.   So the best method is to teach them how to take notes with whatever system you want and then make those notes graded in a weekly check. Use the note checks to focus on the style and process of note taking instead of the actual notes they write. That way they don’t feel like it’s a gotcha game but instead you trying to teach them a skill they really hate and don’t see the point of (but hey  they’re used to that at least).,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",-0.09166666666666667,33538,
