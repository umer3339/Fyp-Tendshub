I've had the chance to visit all four of these countries and thought I'd share a few highlights/must-do's/suggestions for each.   &#x200B;  **Mauritania**:  \-Nouakchott is not a very interesting city. Stay a day  maybe two  but the magic of Mauritania is not here. The National Museum is worth a visit.  \-After a short time in Nouakchott  I chartered a helicopter to Atar  where I then spent 4 days exploring oases and dunes. This is a stereotypical Sahara desert experience but definitely a must-do.  \-Next  with a hired driver  onto Choum it was! There it was time to board the Iron Ore train which takes you on a 16 hour journey from Choum to the city of Nouadhibou on the coast. There are *lots* of blogs and trip reports all over the web about riding the train  so I don't need to go into much detail here. I will say that you need at least 2L of water per person  you need to bring food (which you will share with others  meals are impromptu and communal)  and you need a scarf to cover your head. Viewing the desert rushing by from inside a hopper car on one of the longest trains in the world is an unforgettable experience and truly one of the best ways to see the Sahara. I highly recommend watching this National Geographic short film if you're interested: [https://www.nationalgeographic.com/video/shorts/1264477251753/](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/video/shorts/1264477251753/)  \-3 days in Nouadhibou exploring the coastline and eating seafood (which is spectacular btw) served as an awesome conclusion to the trip.  &#x200B;  **Senegal:**  \-Dakar is **amazing**. If I exclude the cities of South Africa  Dakar is my third favorite city on the continent after Nairobi and Kigali. Dakar is one of the best (and most underrated) food destinations in Africa. Don't go in expecting anything higher-end like you may in Cape Town (see: [The Test Kitchen](https://www.thetestkitchen.co.za/home/))  and you will be pleasantly surprised. Great French  Indian  Moroccan  and (as one might expect) Senegalese food. As someone who enjoys the relaxation of a nice hotel  Dakar is a refreshing opportunity for that in a region of the world (West Africa) where nice hotels are few and far between. I've stayed at the Pullman and the Radisson Blu  and they are both great choices right by the ocean.   \-Lac Rose (aka Lake Retba/Pink Lake) is an hour outside of Dakar and a must-do if you have more than 2 days in the city. It is one of the most surreal things I have ever seen.  \-My only proper trip into the rest of the country was north to the Djoudj National Bird Sanctuary. It was nothing like your typical African safari but was memorable side-trip. Again  a helicopter charter from Dakar offered easy access (compared to what I believe is otherwise a 6-hour drive).  \-Unfortunately  I didn't get a chance to explore the southern part of Senegal  which is largely separated from the north by The Gambia. I'm curious about Ziguinchor (has anyone here been?). If I find myself in Senegal again I will be sure to visit Niokola-Koba National Park. I've seen some lovely photos from the park that piqued my interest.  &#x200B;  **The Gambia:**  \-The Gambia is a fascinating country completely defined by geography. The border follows the winding path of The Gambia River  with the country jutting from the ocean into Senegal like a snake slithering into the jaws of a predator (Weird comparison? Maybe. Accurate and fun? Yep). The capital of Banjul sits at the mouth of the river  where it meets the Atlantic Ocean.   \-Serekunda is a decent city. When it comes to things to do  you'll either be at the beach or the many nature reserves within the city. I had 3 days to take it in and thought it was plenty. The Tanji Bird Reserve about a half hour out of town was my favorite of the reserves  though it doesn't match the experience to be had at Djoudj National Bird Sanctuary in Senegal.   \-Ngala Lodge is without a doubt the best choice for accommodations in Serekunda. The rooms are quite nice  *especially* compared to other options in the region. The location is unbeatable and the general vibe is relaxing and laid back.  \-Banjul is a charming and vibrant city  a must visit for a day or two. The Gambia National Museum is the highlight attraction where I spent a half day. It's tiny but filled with information and artefacts. Albert Market located at the very end of the island on which Banjul sits is chaotic and eye-opening. I wouldn't have been comfortable going alone (and I don't recommend you go alone  even if you're a man  because it's good to have someone who can watch your back for pickpockets) but luckily I had others with me.  \-The highlight of the country isn't the cities on the coast  but rather the river that shapes the nation. I highly recommend a boat tour up the river  but be cautious and do your research beforehand as to a suitable tour company. There are limited options  unfortunately. I used Lam's Tours and had a fantastic experience. You'll come to realize the extent of how important the river is to *everything*.   &#x200B;  **Guinea-Bissau:**  \-I only spent a day and a half in the capital of Bissau (enough to see the National Ethnographic Museum) as I wanted to focus the majority of the trip on the archipelago which lies only a short distance off the coast  the Bijagos Islands. The following will help exactly 0 people reading this  but for the sake of telling a bit of the story of my visit  I'll share. The only reason I ended up in Guinea Bissau is because of a friend I have in Lagos  Nigeria. I was texting him about planning my next vacation  to which he suggested Guinea Bissau  and proposed the idea of meeting me there. You see  he isn't your ordinary Nigerian. He is  simply put  *very* well-off. His proposal was to bring his yacht from Lagos to Bissau  where my husband and I would meet him  and we would sail the Bijagos Islands  explore beaches  and dive with turtles for a week. I couldn't pass up the offer  so my husband and I booked our flights. As an aside  being able to drop everything and go when an opportunity arises can give you memories of a lifetime. If you have the luxury of taking time off work on very short notice  allow yourself to be flexible and take life as opportunities come.   \-Regarding a few specific islands  Poil√£o gives off Hawaii vibes (petrologically)  while Rubane had some of the best beaches. The diving experience offered in the archipelago is one of the best in the world  up there with the Maldives  Seychelles  Indonesia  and the Philippines. ***Criminally underrated****.*,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.20706343336151015,101813,0.172

Senegal is one of my favorites in the region.  It can be a bit frustrating and definitely eye opening if you haven't traveled in third world regions before.  Visas maybe required  so check your passport requirements.  I've been to all 4 of those countries  on separate trips.  Language can be a factor  it is best to know some simple French for Mauritania and Senegal.  The Gambia is English-speaking. Guinea-Bissau is Portuguese.  Here's some photos from my west African trips: https://imgur.com/a/yyqoe  Transport doesn't usually run to a set schedule.  There are taxi brousse (bush taxis) minibuses or beat to hell Peugeot sedans that only depart when full.  And by full that can mean 10 or more people crammed in a 7-seat car.  Count on about $2/hr for the price.  You can buy up extra seats to depart earlier and get extra space.  They typically run fixed routes with fixed prices but you can often just hire out the whole car if you need to go somewhere. Haggling is necessary here!  The taxis usually depart from the gare-routiere (bus station).  When crossing the border south from Mauritania at Rosso (this can be a hassle if you're not used to it.. lots of 'helpers' about) to Senegal  there are cars waiting at the border but they are more expensive.  Cheaper to walk the ~1km to the bus station then catch a taxi from there.  Food is great.  The French influence (Senegal was a French colony for 400 years) means baguettes and croissants are available.  Senegal has its own cuisine  yassa  thiboudienne  etc.  When traveling in Mauritania you need 'fiches'. This is a copy of your passport/visa details and where you're staying/going  etc.  There were several checkpoints along the way south from Nouakchott where we had to provide these.   I printed up a bunch of pre-filled forms with passport details before my trip and just filled in the visa numbers later.  The drive south from Mauritania is all desert through northern Senegal  then slowly starts giving way to the Sahel arid region.  Guinea Bissau and The Gambia are very green compared with northern Senegal.  Money.  Senegal and Guinea-Bissau use the West African CFA regional currency.  It is tied to the Euro.  Mauritania and The Gambia have their own currencies.  I was able to use ATMs just fine everywhere  though in Ziguinchor we had to try several ones before we found one that worked.  If you like old French colonial architecture  don't miss Saint-Louis.  This was the capital of the French West Africa for several hundred years and is packed with crumbling buildings.  The town is located on an island with streets laid out in a grid pattern.  Choice of accommodations can be limited and not generally good value for money.. there really aren't hostels in West Africa.  Some towns may only have one or two places to stay and likely aren't bookable online.  Best choices are in the capital cities and Ziguinchor.   Bissau was the most expensive place we stayed  over $100/night (but I split with travel buddy).  Visas. You will likely need a visa for Mauritania  Guinea-Bissau and possibly The Gambia.  When I visited I also needed a visa for Senegal but they did away with the requirement.  Aussies  Brits  Candians and most Europeans don't require a visa for The Gambia  but Americans  French and Spanish do require one.  For Mauritania you can get a visa on arrival at the airport but not at land borders (best place is to get in Rabat if coming from Morocco).  Guinea-Bissau supposedly you can also get a visa on arrival at the airport (not at land borders)  or there is an e-visa option (https://www.rgb-visa.com/).  We got our visa in ~20 minutes at the consulate in Ziguinchor but make sure that option is still available.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.14093452380952384,101814,

You cannot go in during the prayer if you are not there to pray. This time of the year  southern parts are very crowded as expected  Istanbul is little bit empty  so thats a plus.

Just wanted some advice on my itinerary: if you think it's too busy  if I should spend less/more time in specific cities  if there's anything I should include  etc... I need to fly back to Rome because open jaw tickets were more expensive than just catching a flight/train back to my original spot.  For the record  I'll be with a friend in Munich (I'm not sure if she has much planned so wanted to allow enough time for this)  and again in London (for New Year's Eve).  I originally had Berlin wedged in between Munich and Prague for 2.5 days but I can't justify the 4-hour train ride being worth such little time. If you think I should book it in please advise! I've never been to Europe so I'm not sure what to expect but I'm quite fast-paced and adventurous when I travel so being on the go isn't an issue for me.  And just to note  I've rounded up transportation times and am aware of the extra fluffing around this includes (check-in  getting to hostels  etc).

Trains should be less affected  I think. Flights can also be affected.   \- You have allocated too much time to Munich. I would spend some of that towards Dresden (awesome) and Berlin.

Just 1 small advise; Public Transport in London is waaaay way different over the holidays (there is NO PT during Christmas/Boxing Day).  Uber is a lot cheaper than black-cabs if you can‚Äôt use the tube.

Just wanted some advice on my itinerary: if you think it's too busy  if I should spend less/more time in specific cities  if there's anything I should include  etc... I need to fly back to Rome because open jaw tickets were more expensive than just catching a flight/train back to my original spot.  For the record  I'll be with a friend in Munich (I'm not sure if she has much planned so wanted to allow enough time for this)  and again in London (for New Year's Eve).

A lot of them can also be flexible within your current schedule too since you do have an ample amount of days in most of your locations even factoring in travel time. Some ideas for day trips or overnighters:  Staying a day/night in Salzburg from Vienna to Munich. You could spend one day in the town then the following day go to Berchtesgaden then head to Munich after. Werfen is also beautiful and an option for a daytrip from Salzburg.  Hallstatt would be another option but it's a bit tougher to get to and it's a bit off the path from Vienna to Munich.   Plan a daytrip from Munich. Neuschwanstein is probably the most popular but there are plenty of other options like Mittenwald and Garmisch. Given you are going during Christmas market season Nuremberg would also be a good option and if you do the bus instead of the train you could buy a flexible ticket and see the market on the way to Prague. [There's LOADS of other daytrip options from Munich.](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/b13vlv/i_made_a_big_list_of_daytrips_from_munich_m%C3%BCnchen/)  Another idea is to do your route a tad different and take the train from Munich to Paris to stop in Strasbourg or Colmar. The [Alsace region has a lot to offer on top of that - could easily spend 5 days there - ](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/c63r4w/rtravel_region_of_the_week_alsace/#france) and both Strasbourg and Colmar have great Christmas markets  plus you can eliminate the train. Your route would be Rome-> Vienna-Prague-Munich-Paris instead of your current route. You could still do Salzburg as a daytrip from Munich with that itinerary.  In Prague go outside the city to Kutna Hora one of your days.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.3088888888888889,102147,

Just wanted some advice on my itinerary: if you think it's too busy  if I should spend less/more time in specific cities  if there's anything I should include  etc... I need to fly back to Rome because open jaw tickets were more expensive than just catching a flight/train back to my original spot.  For the record  I'll be with a friend in Munich (I'm not sure if she has much planned so wanted to allow enough time for this)  and again in London (for New Year's Eve).  I originally had Berlin wedged in between Munich and Prague for 2.5 days but I can't justify the 4-hour train ride being worth such little time. If you think I should book it in please advise!

Sometimes outside factors bring additional light to a place which then attracts people  who otherwise would not have known about the place. Unfortunately  so many other places don‚Äôt have this benefit. For example  take the incredibly town of Bruges  which many people have not heard of  aside from the movie  which I‚Äôm not going to mention cuz then the bonehead jokes start about growing up on a farm  etc. But what an amazingly beautiful little city Bruges is.  I was there last summer and it was a nightmare. Every day from around 10am to 4pm the city was mobbed with people from cruise ships.

It can get really cold in early December. Depending of what part of the country you want to visit prepare for the snow or a lot of rain on the continental part (Zagreb  Vara≈ædin  Osijek  Vinkovci....) and for the rain and strong winds on the coast. If you want to visit the islands during the winter time I hope that you can handle rough seas.  Still  it has its beauty no matter what part you want to visit.   I would highly recommend to visit Plitivce lakes in the winter.

500,km8524,DXB Left luggage service,I'm heading into Africa and was hoping to leave a decent amount of my stuff in DXB so I can travel light while in Africa. I'm aware there is a¬†Left Luggage¬†option in Terminal 3 which is available to store my luggage for a few days (checked with Emirates).  My concern is if I were to do this  would I have enough time to retrieve my items.  04:45 - Fly into DXB terminal 2  Pick up luggage from Left Luggage  Go through security  08:00 - Fly out of DXB terminal 3  I'm also aware that it may¬†take up to 40 minutes¬†to transfer between Terminal 2 and Terminal 3 and that the Left Luggage area is outside passport control meaning I would have to re-enter security after getting my luggage.  The question I have is if there is enough time to transit between Terminal 2  to the Left Luggage area and back through security to my gate in Terminal 3. Further  would it be faster if I left the secure area from Terminal 2 and grabbed a cab or use the dedicated bus service?,self,No video,2019-07-15 20:01:23,1.0,1.0,0.0,4_seasons_in_one_day,"So you will need to go through passport control in Terminal 2 first  right? So I guess you are flying in on fly dubai and leaving on Emirates? Are these connections on one ticket? The thing is that if they are on one ticket  you will be herded to the transfer desk and taken from T2 to T3 airside via a shuttle bus.  Technically you need a connection of minimum 6 hours to be able to leave the airport (go through passport control). In practice  this is usually not enforced. ""Usually"" being the key word here.  Personally  I think you simply don't have enough time. So first you need to go through passport control (usually fast and hassle free)  then get to T3  then retrieve your luggage (which may be painfully slow  because the night shift guys just don't care)  then you will need to recheck your luggage with Emirates. And somehow manage to do it all BEFORE the Emirates check-in closes. Because unless you are flying business class  the one carry on rule is strictly enforced in T3.   This is not going to happen.  And what are you going to do if your arriving flight is late? Dubai Airport is massive  as I'm sure you know.  Even if you are not checking in any luggage  some gates in T3 are nearly 30 minutes away from security.

In my opinion  micro 4/3 had the best selection hands down. You can get some stunning  weather sealed  pro level lenses for a fraction of what the equivalent lens would cost in any other system.   I like the Sony alpha system cameras  but their lens selection is poor  and their truly good glass is big and eye wateringly expensive. For what 99% of people do with their photos (ranging from nothing  to Facebook posts)  the sensor size in any micro 4/3 camera is far and away enough.   I use an omd-em5 ii  and have for 7 years. I dumped a pro Canon setup for it and never looked back (I used to be a working pro photographer). The body is weather sealed  and I mainly shoot the oly 12-40 2.8 pro  and it is an incredible setup. Small  super sharp  fully weather sealed (survived the almost constant rain and cold of Scotland no issues)  and tough. I've dragged it through 34 countries and it's still ticking.   The body can be had for peanuts and I bought the lens second hand for 475usd. The prime lenses in the system are also amazing. The 45mm 1.7 is one of the sharpest lenses out there  focuses blazingly fast  and is tiny and cheap. Hard to beat.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.08255555555555558,102319,

Met a Brazilian girl in Budapest at a bar while out on the town one of the nights. We just hit it off so smoothly and ditched the bars and went back to her place after an hour.   Next day we explored a lot of the city and went to the Szechenyi Baths. At night  we got some booze and walked along the Danube right up under the lit up Hungarian Parliament. Ended up hanging out with all the people in the Jewish Quarter and ended the night on the Budapest Eye Ferris Wheel before going back at 4 am.  The next day  she had to leave to a different city  and it sucked because I most likely wasn't going to see her again. Well  she was able to change her plans a week later and ended up going with me to Split  Hvar  and Dubrovnik  and then onto Kotor. We finally had to split up after that and that goodbye was fucking hard.  It was mutually understood between us that we'd both have each other over if she ever came to California or I to Brazil  but who knows how we feel later down the line. I think we both understood it was a travel fling and we just weren't in the position to make it anything more than that.  I was most attached to the Brazilian girl just because of how well we hit it off and we complimented each other so well. Other travel flings here and there were memorable  but just didn't have that lasting impact on me.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.10276052449965492,102344,0.057

Later we drove down to La Jolla and walked along the sand and got some fresh bread at a local bakery and explored local bookshops.   It was so great because of how well we got along together. I felt like we really complemented each other and our spontaneous travel styles meshed beautifully. We talked about eloping right there in that little beach town.

I then knew I'd like to go the Badlands and Roosevelt NP. I knew my wife would love ND's Enchanted Highway. So  we made a rough planner  gave ourselves plenty of time.

Planning a road trip can seem really daunting at times and thoughts like  ""is it really worth all this drive"" Will pop into your head constantly  but with a little planning  being willing to adapt  and a good attitude you are bound to have the time of your life.   &#x200B;  Just like the other commenters said definitely choose which things you are interested in and build a trip around that. I actually did something similar to u/nothinsouth1 recently where my s/o and I knew we wanted to visit the Grand Tetons and Yellowstone so we saw what was on the way and added that to the itinerary. We are in the Detroit area so it included Badlands  Mount Rushmore  Wind Cave  Theodore Roosevelt National Park  and voyageurs. We like hiking and nature so it was easy for us to choose.  &#x200B;  Maybe you are a big foody  craft beer lover  partier  or all 3 (I know I am) find the cities and places that offer the best opportunities for all those things and can be grouped together in one trip and now you have points on a map to make into a road trip.   &#x200B;  As far as time goes  try to keep driving to a minimal  especially if alone  tah tbeing said I never regret driving even if it takes 2 to 3 days to get to the main attraction of the trip. Just throw in some interesting stops along the way and you'll have a blast. Keep costs down by staying in AirBnBs  camping  maybe even hostels depending on the US city  eating cheaper when you can  and using your knowledge of areas to avoid the need for guided tours and such.  &#x200B;  Sorry if this is a little long but I am really passionate about helping people achieve their adventure goals. Hope this helps  happy rod tripping!",,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.14444444444444446,102398,

The great smoky mountains train ride is also nice  and I believe it stops at a white water rafting facility if you‚Äôre interested in that kind of thing. If not  then you can just head back on the train.

We figure it may be our only opportunity for long term travel  since we don‚Äôt own a house and don‚Äôt have to go into the office. This timing works well for our jobs since my husband works in sales and business is slow around the holidays.   We would sell some things and put the rest of our stuff in a storage unit. Family would watch our dog. Other than flights and weekend travel  we‚Äôd expect our day to day costs to be very similar since we currently pay $1700 for rent plus other utilities which would be immediately removed from our budget.   Any suggestions for which cities are most friendly for a longer trip with a small child who may or may not be walking yet? We‚Äôre thinking a month long Airbnb in one major city with weekend trips elsewhere. We have considered London  Paris  Barcelona  and Lisbon.   Special considerations would include making sure we can easily get around by metro or by food for day to day activities and ideally train for other transport. We will bring a car seat but it would be easier if we don‚Äôt have to rent a car for most of the trip. I don‚Äôt know if we need additional medical insurance in case the baby gets sick.

Definitely buy tickets in advance for Park Guell and Sagrada Fam√≠lia. My recommendation would be to do Park Guell in the morning before the crowds set in.   Sagrada Fam√≠lia has tighter restrictions on how many people can be let in and your ticket is for a more specific time  so it‚Äôs not too crowded no matter what time you go at. One thing to think of is that the inside of the Sagrada Fam√≠lia was designed with stained glass windows that color the morning light cool and the evening light warm  so if you have a preference  I would consider that. We went around 4 and I loved it because it was about equally warm and cool lighting at first and got progressively warmer as the sun moved.   From what I saw  Sagrada Fam√≠lia didn‚Äôt really enforce the dress rules too harshly. When they say shoulders and legs  shorts/dress/skirt down to around your knees would be enough as would a short sleeved tee. But when I was there people were in tank tops so idk.   Our favorite tapas place was called Tapas 24! It was delicious. Definitely worth checking out.   While you‚Äôre walking down Las Ramblas  make sure to check out St Joseph‚Äôs market for delicious food! This was one of the highlights of my trip.   Some more things to see and do: check out Hospital de Sant Pau and the magic fountain show at night!   Hope you have a great time!,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.36625514403292175,102456,0.512

I would do Park Guell in the morning and sagrada familia in the afternoon. As others have said Park Guell was underwhelming and not worth it (in my opinion) but do what you want. I wore a short sleeve shirt and skirt that went a little lower than mid-thigh and was good for sagrada familia. As long as your not in short shorts and a string tank top  I think you'll be alright.  Most people speak spanish as well as catalan (and many speak english as well) but i would definitely recommend trying your spanish before reverting to english  they really appreciate it!  Bar Lobo near las ramblas is awesome! Go there! Great drinks and food.  Montjuic was mentioned previously and I recommend that as well. They have a set of cable cars that has a pretty ride and will take you to around to the top.  Another thing we thought was cool was the L'Aquarium. It was nice to escape the heat and see the marine life (they have a really awesome shark tunnel). It didn't take too long to go through (1-2 hrs max) and me and my boyfriend had a great time.  Also the beach kinda sucked (hard gravel-like sand/rocks and super crowded) so if you're going to the islands after I would say skipping it is the right decision.  Happy Travels!,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.26791294642857144,102461,

I‚Äôve heard Casa Mila sunset on the roof is spectacular but I didn‚Äôt personally go  - Las Ramblas sucks. super touristy in the nasty way that many European cities can be at their worst. although we did find some great restaurants nearby  I wouldn‚Äôt spend any other time there  - parts of the beach area suck too  if you insist on the beach go as far north up in the city as possible to avoid tourist traps and huge crowds (ie. Platja de Bogatell)  - Vinitus for the trendiest/best tapas in the city. will be close to where you‚Äôre staying in Eixample. apparently Cerveser√≠a Catalana is also great  - La Sagrada Familia is unbelievably packed but worth it  make sure you get tickets ASAP. try to get tickets that include a trip up one of the towers  that was my favorite part,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.19340277777777776,102462,

If your flight is particularly late  maybe Wednesday would suffice.   Banska Stiavnica is the top attraction  but Spis Castle is worth a visit  too. And of course hiking options are countless! Either in the High Tatras or the Slovak Paradise NP.  About advice for the Hungarian countryside  see [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/hungary/comments/8a8zdo/uvernazzas_unnecessarily_long_guide_to_budapest/) I've written.

I'm just gonna say it's better for you to get over your flight fears  because it'll take you more than a WEEK to get from the US to Turkey by sea  it is ridiculously far to have to get there by ship dude.  have a look at a map and see what bodies of waters you'd have to traverse.  no thanks. 3. you need a visa.  don't know if you looked into that  but I guarantee you american passport holders require a visa to enter Turkey.  afaik you can get this easily online by paying the fee and filling out the required information.  fee is something like 50-60 USD and you can pay it online as well.  print out the e-visa you get and bring it with you when you land (most likely) in istanbul.  the immigration officer will want to see it.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.2148148148148148,102483,

With the rapid deprecation of 747s it's hard to say what you will have available since it sounds like you really want to fly a 747.  If you are looking at the two 747 options today though I'd pick BA from a math standpoint. For main cabin BA is 31"" pitch and 17.5"" width. LH is 31"" pitch but only 17.1"" width. That's quite a narrow seat for 9 hours. If you splurged for premium though LH is 38"" pitch and 19"" width while BA is 0.5"" narrower.

726,obake1,Did I just lose out on my money for my flight booking...,So here's the background:  - booked a flight with expedia with one connecting flight from SFO -> LAX -> NRT round trip under one ticket/itinerary (Singapore and Alaska) - got an email saying return flight from NRT -> LAX got changed and had some proposed times and a 3rd option to request a refund - called expedia to request the refund and was told it was guaranteed since the change was out of my control and wasn't me that initiated it.  It's been about a month and I have to call them week after week to follow up on this and every time I have to re-explain the same story to a different person and it's becoming extremely frustrating that they keep giving me run around answers and no one seems to know what's going on except having to re-open email after email with Singapore since apparently that's the only way they operate is through email. Finally today  an agent told me Singapore denied the claim for a refund.  With that said  was I just flat out lied to initially by expedia? I was told that an involuntary change does allow me to request a refund. Do I just eat the loss on that entire booking?

If you are staying in Maafushi  then go on a day trip to Club Med Kani  they have crazy parties over there  they are sometimes open to day trippers. Other day tripping resorts with parties are Paradise Island and one of the Adaaran resorts  I think they are open to day trippers. But my best bet would be Club Med Kani.  Hotels on Maafushi organize day trips to resorts  so ask if it's possible to join a resort party at night. Just be forewarned  if you do it  then your group will have to pay for a private speedboat transfer. Partying gets very expensive very quickly in the Maldives.  A cheaper option would be the hotel by the airport (Hulhule Airport Hotel)  there are also parties over there. You don't have to be booked into that hotel to enter their bars  but if you do  be prepared that you may have to hang around Male until the morning. Or pay for a private speedboat back to Maafushi (expensive!)   The cheapest option would be to stay on Maafushi and party there - there is a floating bar there that serves alcohol and that's the sole party spot. Arena Hotel has parties by the bikini beach  but no alcohol served there. However  they are still crazy (even though booze free).,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",-0.015444862155388468,102547,

If you don't mind a 2 minute walk to the beach and prefer a very laid back atmosphere (VERY laid back  but still great service and good food) and like to make friends with your fellow travelers  AND affordable (so you can spend your money on other things  like booze)  then Stingray Beach Inn is a good option. It's owned by the same guy that owns Triton Beach Hotel and Spa and you can take advantage of their super cheap excursions.    But if you prefer more posh and classy surroundings  the Arena is the go-to place.   Though  basically  no matter where you are staying  you can pretty much walk into any of the larger hotels and have breakfast  or join their dinner buffet (as long as you pay  of course)  it's all very incestuous on Maafushi.

Thailand is a great place to travel for your first international trip. Be careful of street food - not all street food is a concern but make sure to eat at places with a high turnover of customers. And try things you haven't tried before even if you are not a foodie.  Thai food is incredible and very full of flavour compared to food in the US.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.2695454545454546,102560,

That said  I‚Äôm interested to know what kind of interests you had in the various states  and what kind of landscapes you‚Äôd like to encounter?   Just based on what you‚Äôve said  national parks and beaches seem to be the go and weave a few together  so royal national park near syd  going north you have tea gardens/ hawks nest  then the mid north coast (great lakes / booti booti)  going up to coffs then byron bay  to the Gold Coast (lamington np is worth a visit inland on the end of that route). Plenty of parks and beaches on and off that track  it‚Äôs also a main highway so no real challenging drives  although some of those places can be a bit off the highway. Then you could hop a plane to far north qld and enjoy the gbr and surrounds. If that‚Äôs too much beach  could go up through the hunter valley (wine region) from Newcastle and up through tamworth and then back to the coast.

Baggy clothing kinda works when moving  but there are still parts that will be tight against your skin (butt  thighs  shoulders) that the mosquitoes will find.  The best way to make clothing mosquito-proof is to treat it with Permethrin.  In general  I find baggy clothing to keep me cooler in more arid climates  whereas shorts and tights are better for more humid ones. Just make sure your leggings have a tight enough weave if you're worried about sun protection. UV at altitude ain't a joke.  Mosquitoes definitely can live at altitude though as long as they have water for breeding.

Alternatively  IIRC the hop on/hop off bus goes by Dublin airport and you can buy a 24h tickets. So you can consider doing that on the day while staying by the airport and then also use it as free transport the next morning. I'm generally not a big fan of those buses though but that might work well for you that day.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.16,102614,

You can get a cheap flight to Nyk√∂ping in the evening from Stansted  it's not the easiest transfer from Heathrow but its not terrible either. You can either take the trains (Heathrow Express/regular to Paddington then tube to London Liverpool Street for the Stansted Express) or arrange a taxi between the airports.  Edit: just looked and there is a direct bus between the 2 airports run by National Express.

You can do the cave on Timp but I would recommend the summit trail. It's a long day but if you can make it to the summit  its definitely worth it. If you are feeling crazy you can start at midnight for the sunrise from the peak. Either way come prepared.   In SLC try the Red Iguana  the Kathmandu  or Lucky 13.

You will also want to keep liquids to a bare minimum  so pack empty containers that you can fill up at hostels /  guest houses / hotels  etc.  I'm about 2 months into a year and a half trip with my wife and we have a total of 25 kgs in total  with next to no clothes. The majority of our weight is in recording and editing equipment  so 10 kgs is definitely doable.  The other big consideration will be clothing and footwear. That will depend heavily on the season and climate of the region  but I would still say to try to keep yourself to two full outfits that can be mixed and matched and then maybe pick up cheap replacements along the way.   Get your bags to 10kgs total. Airlines with strict limits absolutely check if your bag looks on the heavy side. It's a real damn pain to be honest. Southeast Asia has limits of 7kg for a lot of flights and it makes us want to pull our hair out! How the hell do the expect anyone to get under 7kgs?! We always end up having to put everything heavy in one backpack and checking it. üò≠  Anyway  best of luck!,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.10218253968253968,102708,0.1

There are a ton of day trips that you can do from there that are absolute musts but I don't know how long you will be there. In Zurich itself  get down to the Bellevue area and start walking around by the water. It's a fantastic area and way better than the Banhofstrasse. You can do a short train ride for about $20 up to Utelyberg for some great vies of the city from above. Otherwise  day trips I would recommend Lauterbrunnen (and if time  a stop in Interlaken on the way and take some time in Bern on the way back). Another great trip would be to Stanz and ride in the funicular to the top of Stanzerhorn and maybe stop in Luzern on the way back. Get an early start and you can get to Zermatt and back in a day. Take the train from Zermatt city up for closer views of the Matterhorn. Rhine Falls is also not to far and is quite a site.  The information desk at the main train station in Zurich is fantastic. They will help you figure out schedules  tracks and look for discounts on prices for you. When we were there 2 months ago  they told us about special passes at the post office that let us go anywhere in Switzerland for 24 hours for $55. Considering the train from Zurich to Lauterbrunnen is $155  that was a great deal. Also  if you already have tram passes to get around Zurich  they will take money off of your train tickets for you.

Expect your accommodations to be very  very expensive. Airbnb is heavily regulated in Japan so your options are pretty limited as well. You'll want to find something sooner rather then later  especially if you can't afford the $4-500/night price range. I stayed in a private room in a hostel in Downtown Vancouver during the 2010 Olympics for something like $150/night  if you manage to find anything that cheap for Tokyo during the Olympics  jump on it.  Getting around shouldn't be hard. Subway trips within the city range from 120 or so Yen up to 300ish IIRC  fares are calculated by distance so a short trip is cheaper than a long one. The trains in Japan are very orderly and there are plenty of staff around to help out  this'll probably be even more apparent during the Games. Just be aware that there are a couple of companies that operate trains in Tokyo and fares don't transfer between different companies. If you want to leave Tokyo during your stay  look into getting a JR pass for unlimited rides for a certain amount of time. It wouldn't be worth it if you were staying in the city  but a round trip ride to Kyoto or Osaka will pretty much cover the cost.  The other option would be to stay in a smaller city with a short train ride into Tokyo. You'll probably save a ton on hotel costs but you'll lose a bit of time commuting every day.  You can get by on about $30-40USD per day for food in Tokyo  even a little less if you don't drink. Even cheap convenience store food is very good.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.08275345622119815,102732,0.0

I'm not from Tokyo but travel there from the US a lot and love the country.  There's a lot of moving parts to figure out but first and foremost is if there are specific events you want to see then figure out where and when those are to work backwards from. Second  do you have an idea how many days you want to stay? Third  is $3000 your budget including airfare  tickets  lodging  food  and souvenirs?  &#x200B;  **Where in Tokyo**  Tokyo is a very large city and it can take a lot of time to move from one side to another. Here is a good start to understand the areas. - [https://trulytokyo.com/tokyo-olympic-venues/](https://trulytokyo.com/tokyo-olympic-venues/) or [https://tokyo2020.org/en/games/venue/olympic/](https://tokyo2020.org/en/games/venue/olympic/)  * Gymnastics will be at the Ariake Gymnastics Centre in the Tokyo Bay Zone * Track will be at the Olympic Stadium in the Heritage Zone near Shinjuku  &#x200B;  **When**  Per the [IOC schedule](https://tokyo2020.org/en/games/schedule/olympic/) Track events will be from 31 July to 8 August. Women's uneven bar finals are 2 August. For gymnastics I can't see which of the qualifying events are for uneven bars prior.  &#x200B;  Overall  with this sort of timeline for events I would center your trip around arriving no later than 31 July to adjust to the time shift from MD. This gives you a day to relax then events between 2 August and 8 August as you see fit. For accommodations most of the hotels that have shown availability are running over $400/night. If a dedicated room is too expensive for you with your budget you can consider staying in a capsule hotel for that duration. My last trip I stayed at two different First Cabin hotels. These are technically capsule hotels but offer a good amount of space for a solo traveler. Airfare schedules also have not yet been released to give you guidance there. You should begin to see airfare become available in about 2 months since it's currently available through 7 June 2020.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.16456043956043953,102733,

I finally booked for $800 and a slightly less convenient itinerary instead.  It was just confusing because Kayak had identified a United/Lufthansa flight that couldn't be found for that price at either airline's sites.    Then I looked into some past complaints about justfly.com  who books on behalf of Kayak  and I see that others have had problems with them before with them coming back a day or two later and saying that they couldn't book your flight.  So I'm going to chalk it up to the flight no longer existing for that price.  Thanks for your help.  On a separate note  United/Lufthansa codesharing is a mess.  You can book with one or the other  but they have difficulty guaranteeing that you can pay for your luggage for both legs together.  Also  I bought on United  but they directed me to Lufthansa wanting $35+ for seat assignments.

Utrecht and Groningen are both nice cities to visit for a few days and ideal for biking  both in town and around the city. Amsterdam is great  also easily bikeable  even with a kid.

South Kensington/Hyde Park   This is the area that I lived in when I studied abroad and although it‚Äôs really posh  it‚Äôs got all of the museums (all free) and Hyde Park only a 5-10 minute walk away. South Kensington or Knightsbridge are probably the best Tube Stop for you to go to for this area. Knightsbridge is right next to the world famous Harrods which is definitely worth exploring although everything in there is crazy expensive it‚Äôs still fun to walk around in. South Kensington station is a bit closer to all of the museums though so whatever you‚Äôre feeling you can pick  or just stop by one then tube to the other.      Sidenote #1   Pub food is just generally not very good. I would absolutely recommend going out to pubs to drink and watch soccer games or just to hangout at but just be warned that your average pub food is not going to be what you want to have for dinner.     Piccadilly   Picadilly is a cool area that I would probably recommend if you wanted to see a play while you‚Äôre in London (I got last minute tickets to Les Mis last time I was there and it was fantastic). There‚Äôs a ton of theaters and we saw some cool shows over there  plus its right next to London‚Äôs Chinatown district which has some decent food (and oddly enough a few decent Irish Pub‚Äôs - O‚ÄôNeills and Waxy O‚ÄôConnor‚Äôs)      Trafalgar Square/Westminster   This is probably one of the most iconic areas of London and a must-do. If you like a little bit of history I would 100% recommend visiting the Churchill War Rooms. It‚Äôs the center of operations that the British government essential ran out of during WWII and is very close to 10 Downing Street (Residence of the Prime Minister and about halfway between Trafalgar and Westminster). The London Eye is absolutely worth it  even if just for some sweet pics with Parliament in the background  but definitely walk around Westminster Abbey and take in the sights.    Trafalgar Square is an amazing sight to see and isn‚Äôt a far walk from Westminster  plus you have the National Portrait Gallery which I‚Äôm not completely sure if it costs money to get into but is another cool museum if you are into that kind of thing.     Sidenote #2   I used to work in this area so if you are getting really hungry near Westminster but feel the energy to take a short stroll then walk Southwest down Victoria Street until you hit Strutton Ground (turn left). They always had a really cool food market with all sorts of stuff that I would go eat lunch at almost every day when I was interning  lot‚Äôs of choices.     Other Attractions of Note  Shakespeare‚Äôs Theatre  London Tower  Buckingham Palace  St. Paul‚Äôs Cathedral  Paddington Station   Regents Park  Abbey Road  King‚Äôs Cross (Notable spot for taking a Harry Potter picture with Platform 9 3/4)  The Shard (Best view in the whole city)   Final Note: London is huge. The Tube is relatively easy to use and is way more reliable/consistent than any other public metro rail I‚Äôve had to deal with  so you can get around pretty easily. You‚Äôre going to have a great time but don‚Äôt just stick to my list - go out and explore because there really is so much to see.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.1734120783730158,102865,

Unfortunately availability is all booked up during my visit and I cant imagine taking possibly my only trip to Rome without seeing them.  For what it's worth  I really don't mind waiting in lines to see cool things  I've heard that you're often stuck with an hour long wait but to me that seems worth it. Is the hour wait time usually about right? I've also read that waiting until near closing times makes the wait for tickets shorter  but I dont want a rushed experience. I'd rather just take my time and appreciate the art.

Sometimes however it's actually cheaper and faster to use a low-cost airline to fly within Europe  even considering the time you'll spend getting to/from airports.  Personally I'd open up Google Maps  check the location of the places you definitely want to visit  and then see if you can join them up with other places ‚Äì maybe taking a train between a few cities  and then flying on somewhere else. It really depends how extensively you want to explore Europe.  If you're just aiming for the places you've listed  I'd go:  *Fly into London*   *London > Paris train*   *Paris > Germany flight*   *Germany > Austria/Switzerland > Italy train*   *Fly out of Italy*  Finding stuff 'off the beaten path' is really something you should be looking at weeks before you travel  or even when you've arrived  rather than this far in advance. Cities change so much  new places open and close  that it's kind of a waste of time planning that amount of detail right now. It's certainly worth making a note of the more touristy and sightseeing things you want to do in advance  and then filling in the gaps when the time comes.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.2481626328217237,102915,

There's also the Henry Ford Museum just Outside of Detroit Michigan  Which is one of the biggest and best American history museums in existence. The place is incredible  should definitely be high on your list (Detroit is worth seeing too! There's a ton of interesting art installations and galleries and trendy restaurants and it's beginning to have a little revival.)  Ottawa and Montreal are both worthwhile. The Canadian History Museum in Ottawa might be particularly worthwhile for non Canadians to learn a bit about Canada. There are a bunch of other Museums and parks in Ottawa to see as well. It's our Capital  so it's quite pretty and got a lot going on.  If you like the outdoors  you should see Algonquin Park and Muskoka. There's a really good visitor centre at the park that explains it's unique geography (which is wackier and more interesting than you might think) and you might see a moose or a bear on the drive there. The cruises on the bigger Muskoka lakes are great for seeing all the celebrity homes (it is secretly a big getaway for them - as big as the Hamptons - but more hush hush). On the way up to that Georgian Bay area  you could stop at St. Marie among the Hurons which is a really unique historical site that will teach you a bit about some of our indigenous peoples and early colonial history. Georgian Bay is particularly gorgeous. Ruggedly beautiful.   Once you've seen some of our northern nature  and are back in Toronto  do make a daytrip to the McMicheal gallery! It's in a cute little town an hour north of the city and it showcases Canadian artists - especially the Group of Seven who liked to paint the landscape of places like Georgian Bay and Algonquin park.   That's a good start. It's a big area. Probably much  much  much bigger than you think. There are six million people. in the GTA (Greater Toronto Area).

The [Stratford Festival](https://www.stratfordfestival.ca/) is really really good and worth seeing a play or two!  Grand Bend is another part of the province that is worth a look. Lake Huron is a really fun Great Lake with good beaches. No idea how you'd get out there by bus. You sure you cannot rent a car??  Tobermory and the Bruce Peninsula is gorgeous.

To allow for even one day in theory getting you able to fly on Monday the cheapest options will be out of Charlotte (CLT) flying to Vancouver (YVR). Round-trip flights are running around $360 round trip + bags with travel time around 8 hours. Victoria BC is a small airport and a bit north of the city anyway hence it's more expensive to fly all the way there.  The cheapest to Victoria is around $503 but that's 19 hours of travel. In that extra time I would advise still flying to Vancouver and then catching the BC Ferries connector bus that will take you directly from the Vancouver airport to downtown Victoria without transfer. This is $81 CAD (\~$62 US) per person for the journey over. If you brought carry on only this would mean around $484 round trip from NC.  An alternate option is to fly to Seattle and then take the Victoria Clipper ferry from downtown right into the inner harbor. This will be a more expensive option around $484 for airfare plus $119 each way for the ferry. The benefit though is you can get all the way to Seattle without the need of a passport giving you some time.  &#x200B;  I have not searched for MD flights but starting to illustrate some options.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.12709627329192547,102959,

Its not the end of the world as there is transit service to the ferry terminal (I have seen people myself taking the Canada Line and then the 620 to the ferry) but if you are travelling with a lot of bags then maybe it's not the best option.  If you are planning to purchase a one way ticket then maybe flying into Victoria is the better option (212 to YVR vs 283 to YYJ) but its really up to you as gneedles outlined some great options.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.44285714285714295,102962,

You could fly out later today your time (Sunday) arriving in Seattle on Monday night to hit the passport agency first thing Monday morning. A 24 hour turnaround on the passport fingers crossed would mean documentation ready to travel on Tuesday morning. Albeit too late to catch the Clipper on Tuesday you could catch it Wednesday morning 07:30 arriving in Victoria 10:30.  Unfortunately  if you want to fly to Canada (Vancouver or Victoria) you will not be able to depart until you have passports in hand which wouldn't be until Tuesday at the earliest.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.178125,102965,

If there's a disabled passenger they know before hand and all their needs are forwarded to the boarding employees.  So I arrive to my connecting flight 10 minutes before boarding  let them know I'm there and chill out.

That's when the radio chaos starts. They don't have the transfer chair and have to wait for someone to bring it up  and they can't board the other passengers before me for safety reasons. We're in full view of the other passengers but too far for them to hear what's going on.  So 30 minutes go by  I'm not pissed off  shit happens and I get it  and then finally a guy brings the transfer chair. Awesome  let's get this show on the road.  Well before they roll my ass down to the plane an attendant gets on the intercom:  *""We're sorry for the delay * ***we were waiting on a disabled passenger *** *we will begin boarding shortly""*  I'm clearly the only disabled passenger.

If there's a disabled passenger they know before hand and all their needs are forwarded to the boarding employees.  So I arrive to my connecting flight 10 minutes before boarding  let them know I'm there and chill out.  Once the boarding time starts they call me over  check my ID and have me wait by the front near the doors.  One employee asks if I can walk to my seat  and I say no.  That's when the radio chaos starts. They don't have the transfer chair and have to wait for someone to bring it up  and they can't board the other passengers before me for safety reasons. We're in full view of the other passengers but too far for them to hear what's going on.  So 30 minutes go by  I'm not pissed off  shit happens and I get it  and then finally a guy brings the transfer chair. Awesome  let's get this show on the road.  Well before they roll my ass down to the plane an attendant gets on the intercom:  *""We're sorry for the delay * ***we were waiting on a disabled passenger *** *we will begin boarding shortly""*  I'm clearly the only disabled passenger.  Everyone looks at me as I'm right in the front.  This is fucking **humiliating.**  Bitch your ass wasn't waiting *for me * I was waiting *for you.*  I did everything right  I gave everyone the right info  I was early  I even organize my shit so I can board quickly and have no carry on luggage.  Even if it WERE my fault  how the fuck do you think that's appropriate to announce that to a fucking audience?!  &#x200B;  Edit: it's way too late to report it.",self,No video,2019-07-14 04:36:24,53.0,43.0,51.0,Anzai,This whole thread is full of over dramatic rants.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.03888888888888892,103036,
