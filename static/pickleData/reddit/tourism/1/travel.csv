I've had the chance to visit all four of these countries and thought I'd share a few highlights/must-do's/suggestions for each.   &#x200B;  **Mauritania**:  \-Nouakchott is not a very interesting city. Stay a day  maybe two  but the magic of Mauritania is not here. The National Museum is worth a visit.  \-After a short time in Nouakchott  I chartered a helicopter to Atar  where I then spent 4 days exploring oases and dunes. This is a stereotypical Sahara desert experience but definitely a must-do.  \-Next  with a hired driver  onto Choum it was! There it was time to board the Iron Ore train which takes you on a 16 hour journey from Choum to the city of Nouadhibou on the coast. There are *lots* of blogs and trip reports all over the web about riding the train  so I don't need to go into much detail here. I will say that you need at least 2L of water per person  you need to bring food (which you will share with others  meals are impromptu and communal)  and you need a scarf to cover your head. Viewing the desert rushing by from inside a hopper car on one of the longest trains in the world is an unforgettable experience and truly one of the best ways to see the Sahara. I highly recommend watching this National Geographic short film if you're interested: [https://www.nationalgeographic.com/video/shorts/1264477251753/](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/video/shorts/1264477251753/)  \-3 days in Nouadhibou exploring the coastline and eating seafood (which is spectacular btw) served as an awesome conclusion to the trip.  &#x200B;  **Senegal:**  \-Dakar is **amazing**. If I exclude the cities of South Africa  Dakar is my third favorite city on the continent after Nairobi and Kigali. Dakar is one of the best (and most underrated) food destinations in Africa. Don't go in expecting anything higher-end like you may in Cape Town (see: [The Test Kitchen](https://www.thetestkitchen.co.za/home/))  and you will be pleasantly surprised. Great French  Indian  Moroccan  and (as one might expect) Senegalese food. As someone who enjoys the relaxation of a nice hotel  Dakar is a refreshing opportunity for that in a region of the world (West Africa) where nice hotels are few and far between. I've stayed at the Pullman and the Radisson Blu  and they are both great choices right by the ocean.   \-Lac Rose (aka Lake Retba/Pink Lake) is an hour outside of Dakar and a must-do if you have more than 2 days in the city. It is one of the most surreal things I have ever seen.  \-My only proper trip into the rest of the country was north to the Djoudj National Bird Sanctuary. It was nothing like your typical African safari but was memorable side-trip. Again  a helicopter charter from Dakar offered easy access (compared to what I believe is otherwise a 6-hour drive).  \-Unfortunately  I didn't get a chance to explore the southern part of Senegal  which is largely separated from the north by The Gambia. I'm curious about Ziguinchor (has anyone here been?). If I find myself in Senegal again I will be sure to visit Niokola-Koba National Park. I've seen some lovely photos from the park that piqued my interest.  &#x200B;  **The Gambia:**  \-The Gambia is a fascinating country completely defined by geography. The border follows the winding path of The Gambia River  with the country jutting from the ocean into Senegal like a snake slithering into the jaws of a predator (Weird comparison? Maybe. Accurate and fun? Yep). The capital of Banjul sits at the mouth of the river  where it meets the Atlantic Ocean.   \-Serekunda is a decent city. When it comes to things to do  you'll either be at the beach or the many nature reserves within the city. I had 3 days to take it in and thought it was plenty. The Tanji Bird Reserve about a half hour out of town was my favorite of the reserves  though it doesn't match the experience to be had at Djoudj National Bird Sanctuary in Senegal.   \-Ngala Lodge is without a doubt the best choice for accommodations in Serekunda. The rooms are quite nice  *especially* compared to other options in the region. The location is unbeatable and the general vibe is relaxing and laid back.  \-Banjul is a charming and vibrant city  a must visit for a day or two. The Gambia National Museum is the highlight attraction where I spent a half day. It's tiny but filled with information and artefacts. Albert Market located at the very end of the island on which Banjul sits is chaotic and eye-opening. I wouldn't have been comfortable going alone (and I don't recommend you go alone  even if you're a man  because it's good to have someone who can watch your back for pickpockets) but luckily I had others with me.  \-The highlight of the country isn't the cities on the coast  but rather the river that shapes the nation. I highly recommend a boat tour up the river  but be cautious and do your research beforehand as to a suitable tour company. There are limited options  unfortunately. I used Lam's Tours and had a fantastic experience. You'll come to realize the extent of how important the river is to *everything*.   &#x200B;  **Guinea-Bissau:**  \-I only spent a day and a half in the capital of Bissau (enough to see the National Ethnographic Museum) as I wanted to focus the majority of the trip on the archipelago which lies only a short distance off the coast  the Bijagos Islands. The following will help exactly 0 people reading this  but for the sake of telling a bit of the story of my visit  I'll share. The only reason I ended up in Guinea Bissau is because of a friend I have in Lagos  Nigeria. I was texting him about planning my next vacation  to which he suggested Guinea Bissau  and proposed the idea of meeting me there. You see  he isn't your ordinary Nigerian. He is  simply put  *very* well-off. His proposal was to bring his yacht from Lagos to Bissau  where my husband and I would meet him  and we would sail the Bijagos Islands  explore beaches  and dive with turtles for a week. I couldn't pass up the offer  so my husband and I booked our flights. As an aside  being able to drop everything and go when an opportunity arises can give you memories of a lifetime. If you have the luxury of taking time off work on very short notice  allow yourself to be flexible and take life as opportunities come.   \-Regarding a few specific islands  Poilão gives off Hawaii vibes (petrologically)  while Rubane had some of the best beaches. The diving experience offered in the archipelago is one of the best in the world  up there with the Maldives  Seychelles  Indonesia  and the Philippines. ***Criminally underrated****.*,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.20706343336151015,101813,0.172

Senegal is one of my favorites in the region.  It can be a bit frustrating and definitely eye opening if you haven't traveled in third world regions before.  Visas maybe required  so check your passport requirements.  I've been to all 4 of those countries  on separate trips.  Language can be a factor  it is best to know some simple French for Mauritania and Senegal.  The Gambia is English-speaking. Guinea-Bissau is Portuguese.  Here's some photos from my west African trips: https://imgur.com/a/yyqoe  Transport doesn't usually run to a set schedule.  There are taxi brousse (bush taxis) minibuses or beat to hell Peugeot sedans that only depart when full.  And by full that can mean 10 or more people crammed in a 7-seat car.  Count on about $2/hr for the price.  You can buy up extra seats to depart earlier and get extra space.  They typically run fixed routes with fixed prices but you can often just hire out the whole car if you need to go somewhere. Haggling is necessary here!  The taxis usually depart from the gare-routiere (bus station).  When crossing the border south from Mauritania at Rosso (this can be a hassle if you're not used to it.. lots of 'helpers' about) to Senegal  there are cars waiting at the border but they are more expensive.  Cheaper to walk the ~1km to the bus station then catch a taxi from there.  Food is great.  The French influence (Senegal was a French colony for 400 years) means baguettes and croissants are available.  Senegal has its own cuisine  yassa  thiboudienne  etc.  When traveling in Mauritania you need 'fiches'. This is a copy of your passport/visa details and where you're staying/going  etc.  There were several checkpoints along the way south from Nouakchott where we had to provide these.   I printed up a bunch of pre-filled forms with passport details before my trip and just filled in the visa numbers later.  The drive south from Mauritania is all desert through northern Senegal  then slowly starts giving way to the Sahel arid region.  Guinea Bissau and The Gambia are very green compared with northern Senegal.  Money.  Senegal and Guinea-Bissau use the West African CFA regional currency.  It is tied to the Euro.  Mauritania and The Gambia have their own currencies.  I was able to use ATMs just fine everywhere  though in Ziguinchor we had to try several ones before we found one that worked.  If you like old French colonial architecture  don't miss Saint-Louis.  This was the capital of the French West Africa for several hundred years and is packed with crumbling buildings.  The town is located on an island with streets laid out in a grid pattern.  Choice of accommodations can be limited and not generally good value for money.. there really aren't hostels in West Africa.  Some towns may only have one or two places to stay and likely aren't bookable online.  Best choices are in the capital cities and Ziguinchor.   Bissau was the most expensive place we stayed  over $100/night (but I split with travel buddy).  Visas. You will likely need a visa for Mauritania  Guinea-Bissau and possibly The Gambia.  When I visited I also needed a visa for Senegal but they did away with the requirement.  Aussies  Brits  Candians and most Europeans don't require a visa for The Gambia  but Americans  French and Spanish do require one.  For Mauritania you can get a visa on arrival at the airport but not at land borders (best place is to get in Rabat if coming from Morocco).  Guinea-Bissau supposedly you can also get a visa on arrival at the airport (not at land borders)  or there is an e-visa option (https://www.rgb-visa.com/).  We got our visa in ~20 minutes at the consulate in Ziguinchor but make sure that option is still available.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.14093452380952384,101814,

You cannot go in during the prayer if you are not there to pray. This time of the year  southern parts are very crowded as expected  Istanbul is little bit empty  so thats a plus.

Be sure to spend some time in Brunswick Heads (a more low key version of Byron Bay) and Port Stephens/Nelson Bay is also lovely. Look at holiday parks for good  simple but comfortable accommodation. Good time for whale spotting also. Haven’t been to Coffs or Port Macquarie but have heard great things. Enjoy the drive...I love northern NSW (and FNQ - lived there for a while).

The Van Gogh is a good museum if you get the interactive tour guide  first time I went in there I was out in 30 mins  the second time I went I got the interactive tour guide and I was in there for 3 hours just learning the history of Van Gogh and I’m not even that into art. One last place I’d recommend is the Moco museum because the last time I went they had a banksy convention on  but I’m not sure if it’s still there now :),,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.259375,102119,

317,iwantoatmeal,How's my Europe Winter travel itinerary?,Hey everyone   I'm a 20-year-old female travelling solo to Europe in Dec/Jan. Just wanted some advice on my itinerary: if you think it's too busy  if I should spend less/more time in specific cities  if there's anything I should include  etc... I need to fly back to Rome because open jaw tickets were more expensive than just catching a flight/train back to my original spot.  For the record  I'll be with a friend in Munich (I'm not sure if she has much planned so wanted to allow enough time for this)  and again in London (for New Year's Eve).  I originally had Berlin wedged in between Munich and Prague for 2.5 days but I can't justify the 4-hour train ride being worth such little time. If you think I should book it in please advise! I've never been to Europe so I'm not sure what to expect but I'm quite fast-paced and adventurous when I travel so being on the go isn't an issue for me.  And just to note  I've rounded up transportation times and am aware of the extra fluffing around this includes (check-in  getting to hostels  etc). I am aware that this itinerary includes a large proportion of travel time and I am prepared for that.  So without further ado  here's what you all came for:  10 Dec – Later NZ!    11 Dec – Land in Rome @ 1400    12 Dec – Rome    13 Dec – Rome    14 Dec – Fly (5h) to Vienna     15 Dec – Vienna     16 Dec – Vienna     17 Dec – Vienna    18 Dec – Early bus (5h) to Munich    19 Dec – Munich    20 Dec – Munich     21 Dec – Munich     22 Dec – Munich    23 Dec – Early bus (5h) to Prague    24 Dec – Prague    25 Dec – Prague    26 Dec – Prague    27 Dec – Fly (5h) to London    28 Dec – London    29 Dec – London    30 Dec – London    31 Dec – London    01 Jan – Train (3h) to Paris    02 Jan – Paris    03 Jan – Paris    04 Jan – Paris    05 Jan – Paris    06 Jan – Fly (5h) to Barcelona    07 Jan – Barcelona    08 Jan – Barcelona    09 Jan – Barcelona    10 Jan – Barcelona    11 Jan – Fly (5h) to Rome    12 Jan – Morning flight home  Thanks in advance for all your help and happy travels!

Trains should be less affected  I think. Flights can also be affected.   \- You have allocated too much time to Munich. I would spend some of that towards Dresden (awesome) and Berlin.

Just wanted some advice on my itinerary: if you think it's too busy  if I should spend less/more time in specific cities  if there's anything I should include  etc... I need to fly back to Rome because open jaw tickets were more expensive than just catching a flight/train back to my original spot.  For the record  I'll be with a friend in Munich (I'm not sure if she has much planned so wanted to allow enough time for this)  and again in London (for New Year's Eve).  I originally had Berlin wedged in between Munich and Prague for 2.5 days but I can't justify the 4-hour train ride being worth such little time. If you think I should book it in please advise! I've never been to Europe so I'm not sure what to expect but I'm quite fast-paced and adventurous when I travel so being on the go isn't an issue for me.

You could add a week to Rome and still have stuff to do  and Vienna  while absolutely stunning  is small and you don't need that much time. You need to budget 1/2 for the Vatican alone (it's a must-do IMO).  &#x200B;  Someone said shave time off Barcelona  however it will be easily the warmest weather of any of the places you are going and I think you'll enjoy that  plus there is plenty to do here to fill 4.5 days.  &#x200B;  Gonna be an epic trip  enjoy OP,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.25416666666666665,102134,

Would shave off a day in Munich and spend it elsewhere but that’s more of a personal taste.  Just 1 small advise; Public Transport in London is waaaay way different over the holidays (there is NO PT during Christmas/Boxing Day).  Uber is a lot cheaper than black-cabs if you can’t use the tube. Otherwise there are car services you can book in advance to save you some ££ to spend on pints and souvenirs :),,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.20714285714285716,102135,

For the record  I'll be with a friend in Munich (I'm not sure if she has much planned so wanted to allow enough time for this)  and again in London (for New Year's Eve).  I originally had Berlin wedged in between Munich and Prague for 2.5 days but I can't justify the 4-hour train ride being worth such little time. If you think I should book it in please advise! I've never been to Europe so I'm not sure what to expect but I'm quite fast-paced and adventurous when I travel so being on the go isn't an issue for me.  And just to note  I've rounded up transportation times and am aware of the extra fluffing around this includes (check-in  getting to hostels  etc).

A lot of them can also be flexible within your current schedule too since you do have an ample amount of days in most of your locations even factoring in travel time. Some ideas for day trips or overnighters:  Staying a day/night in Salzburg from Vienna to Munich. You could spend one day in the town then the following day go to Berchtesgaden then head to Munich after. Werfen is also beautiful and an option for a daytrip from Salzburg.  Hallstatt would be another option but it's a bit tougher to get to and it's a bit off the path from Vienna to Munich.   Plan a daytrip from Munich. Neuschwanstein is probably the most popular but there are plenty of other options like Mittenwald and Garmisch. Given you are going during Christmas market season Nuremberg would also be a good option and if you do the bus instead of the train you could buy a flexible ticket and see the market on the way to Prague. [There's LOADS of other daytrip options from Munich.](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/b13vlv/i_made_a_big_list_of_daytrips_from_munich_m%C3%BCnchen/)  Another idea is to do your route a tad different and take the train from Munich to Paris to stop in Strasbourg or Colmar. The [Alsace region has a lot to offer on top of that - could easily spend 5 days there - ](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/c63r4w/rtravel_region_of_the_week_alsace/#france) and both Strasbourg and Colmar have great Christmas markets  plus you can eliminate the train. Your route would be Rome-> Vienna-Prague-Munich-Paris instead of your current route. You could still do Salzburg as a daytrip from Munich with that itinerary.  In Prague go outside the city to Kutna Hora one of your days.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.3088888888888889,102147,

337,iwantoatmeal,How's my Europe Winter travel itinerary?,Hey everyone   I'm a 20-year-old female travelling solo to Europe in Dec/Jan. Just wanted some advice on my itinerary: if you think it's too busy  if I should spend less/more time in specific cities  if there's anything I should include  etc... I need to fly back to Rome because open jaw tickets were more expensive than just catching a flight/train back to my original spot.  For the record  I'll be with a friend in Munich (I'm not sure if she has much planned so wanted to allow enough time for this)  and again in London (for New Year's Eve).  I originally had Berlin wedged in between Munich and Prague for 2.5 days but I can't justify the 4-hour train ride being worth such little time. If you think I should book it in please advise! I've never been to Europe so I'm not sure what to expect but I'm quite fast-paced and adventurous when I travel so being on the go isn't an issue for me.  And just to note  I've rounded up transportation times and am aware of the extra fluffing around this includes (check-in  getting to hostels  etc).

346,You_Is_Me,A bike ride in the mountains   Lyon - France,Hey everyone   I'm a 20-year-old female travelling solo to Europe in Dec/Jan. Just wanted some advice on my itinerary: if you think it's too busy  if I should spend less/more time in specific cities  if there's anything I should include  etc... I need to fly back to Rome because open jaw tickets were more expensive than just catching a flight/train back to my original spot.  For the record  I'll be with a friend in Munich (I'm not sure if she has much planned so wanted to allow enough time for this)  and again in London (for New Year's Eve).  I originally had Berlin wedged in between Munich and Prague for 2.5 days but I can't justify the 4-hour train ride being worth such little time. If you think I should book it in please advise! I've never been to Europe so I'm not sure what to expect but I'm quite fast-paced and adventurous when I travel so being on the go isn't an issue for me.

Sometimes outside factors bring additional light to a place which then attracts people  who otherwise would not have known about the place. Unfortunately  so many other places don’t have this benefit. For example  take the incredibly town of Bruges  which many people have not heard of  aside from the movie  which I’m not going to mention cuz then the bonehead jokes start about growing up on a farm  etc. But what an amazingly beautiful little city Bruges is.  I was there last summer and it was a nightmare. Every day from around 10am to 4pm the city was mobbed with people from cruise ships.

It can get really cold in early December. Depending of what part of the country you want to visit prepare for the snow or a lot of rain on the continental part (Zagreb  Varaždin  Osijek  Vinkovci....) and for the rain and strong winds on the coast. If you want to visit the islands during the winter time I hope that you can handle rough seas.  Still  it has its beauty no matter what part you want to visit.   I would highly recommend to visit Plitivce lakes in the winter. Some sights there you will never forget (Google images if you don't believe me ;)),,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.040555555555555546,102269,

500,km8524,DXB Left luggage service,I'm heading into Africa and was hoping to leave a decent amount of my stuff in DXB so I can travel light while in Africa. I'm aware there is a Left Luggage option in Terminal 3 which is available to store my luggage for a few days (checked with Emirates).  My concern is if I were to do this  would I have enough time to retrieve my items.  04:45 - Fly into DXB terminal 2  Pick up luggage from Left Luggage  Go through security  08:00 - Fly out of DXB terminal 3  I'm also aware that it may take up to 40 minutes to transfer between Terminal 2 and Terminal 3 and that the Left Luggage area is outside passport control meaning I would have to re-enter security after getting my luggage.  The question I have is if there is enough time to transit between Terminal 2  to the Left Luggage area and back through security to my gate in Terminal 3. Further  would it be faster if I left the secure area from Terminal 2 and grabbed a cab or use the dedicated bus service?,self,No video,2019-07-15 20:01:23,1.0,1.0,0.0,4_seasons_in_one_day,"So you will need to go through passport control in Terminal 2 first  right? So I guess you are flying in on fly dubai and leaving on Emirates? Are these connections on one ticket? The thing is that if they are on one ticket  you will be herded to the transfer desk and taken from T2 to T3 airside via a shuttle bus.  Technically you need a connection of minimum 6 hours to be able to leave the airport (go through passport control). In practice  this is usually not enforced. ""Usually"" being the key word here.  Personally  I think you simply don't have enough time. So first you need to go through passport control (usually fast and hassle free)  then get to T3  then retrieve your luggage (which may be painfully slow  because the night shift guys just don't care)  then you will need to recheck your luggage with Emirates. And somehow manage to do it all BEFORE the Emirates check-in closes. Because unless you are flying business class  the one carry on rule is strictly enforced in T3.   This is not going to happen.  And what are you going to do if your arriving flight is late? Dubai Airport is massive  as I'm sure you know.  Even if you are not checking in any luggage  some gates in T3 are nearly 30 minutes away from security.

In my opinion  micro 4/3 had the best selection hands down. You can get some stunning  weather sealed  pro level lenses for a fraction of what the equivalent lens would cost in any other system.   I like the Sony alpha system cameras  but their lens selection is poor  and their truly good glass is big and eye wateringly expensive. For what 99% of people do with their photos (ranging from nothing  to Facebook posts)  the sensor size in any micro 4/3 camera is far and away enough.   I use an omd-em5 ii  and have for 7 years. I dumped a pro Canon setup for it and never looked back (I used to be a working pro photographer). The body is weather sealed  and I mainly shoot the oly 12-40 2.8 pro  and it is an incredible setup. Small  super sharp  fully weather sealed (survived the almost constant rain and cold of Scotland no issues)  and tough. I've dragged it through 34 countries and it's still ticking.   The body can be had for peanuts and I bought the lens second hand for 475usd. The prime lenses in the system are also amazing. The 45mm 1.7 is one of the sharpest lenses out there  focuses blazingly fast  and is tiny and cheap.

Met a Brazilian girl in Budapest at a bar while out on the town one of the nights. We just hit it off so smoothly and ditched the bars and went back to her place after an hour.   Next day we explored a lot of the city and went to the Szechenyi Baths. At night  we got some booze and walked along the Danube right up under the lit up Hungarian Parliament. Ended up hanging out with all the people in the Jewish Quarter and ended the night on the Budapest Eye Ferris Wheel before going back at 4 am.  The next day  she had to leave to a different city  and it sucked because I most likely wasn't going to see her again. Well  she was able to change her plans a week later and ended up going with me to Split  Hvar  and Dubrovnik  and then onto Kotor. We finally had to split up after that and that goodbye was fucking hard.  It was mutually understood between us that we'd both have each other over if she ever came to California or I to Brazil  but who knows how we feel later down the line. I think we both understood it was a travel fling and we just weren't in the position to make it anything more than that.  I was most attached to the Brazilian girl just because of how well we hit it off and we complimented each other so well. Other travel flings here and there were memorable  but just didn't have that lasting impact on me.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.10276052449965492,102344,0.057

547,Acceptable_Topic,Renting cars with Avis and not getting a full fuel tank.,I'm not a very frequent user of rental cars  but I do rent 3-4 cars a year. It has always struck me that their cars seemed to consume a lot gas  when I calculated the consumption based on mileage and tank size. The pattern of high consumption would change once I would fill up the car myself. I found it odd  but never thought Avis could be so obvious as to not fill up the cars properly to save money / scam customers.  This changed when I was given a car whose fuel level indicator dropped basically while I was rolling off their premises. I called their hotline to let them know about it and they refunded me 1/8th of a tank.  When I rented the last car I had time at my hands and went to the gas station right around the corner from their office to check. Oh wonder  I was able to put another 5 litres into it.

I only spent 2-ish days there and wish I had more time for sure. They pretty much nailed all the things you should do but if you are like me and sometimes enjoy a wild night out while traveling look up the Frankenstein Bar in Edinburgh. A little cheesy but at the same time the theme was cool. I went on a weekday and it wasn't as crazy as it should've been but I heard that it gets quite fun on weekends.   &#x200B;  Fun extra if you want to stop on your way up to Edinburgh I highly suggest heading into Lake District National Park. Windermere in particular. I tend to travel with a large interest in hiking and nature so I loved it but maybe it wouldn't tickle your fancy as much but seeing the rolling hills covered in the white homes and distant mountains with a light dusting of snow while spending the night in a sleepy English village straight out of a Jane Austen novel is something/somewhere I will never forget.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.12155187074829933,102380,

Definitely buy tickets in advance for Park Guell and Sagrada Família. My recommendation would be to do Park Guell in the morning before the crowds set in.   Sagrada Família has tighter restrictions on how many people can be let in and your ticket is for a more specific time  so it’s not too crowded no matter what time you go at. One thing to think of is that the inside of the Sagrada Família was designed with stained glass windows that color the morning light cool and the evening light warm  so if you have a preference  I would consider that. We went around 4 and I loved it because it was about equally warm and cool lighting at first and got progressively warmer as the sun moved.   From what I saw  Sagrada Família didn’t really enforce the dress rules too harshly. When they say shoulders and legs  shorts/dress/skirt down to around your knees would be enough as would a short sleeved tee. But when I was there people were in tank tops so idk.   Our favorite tapas place was called Tapas 24! It was delicious. Definitely worth checking out.   While you’re walking down Las Ramblas  make sure to check out St Joseph’s market for delicious food! This was one of the highlights of my trip.   Some more things to see and do: check out Hospital de Sant Pau and the magic fountain show at night!   Hope you have a great time!,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.36625514403292175,102456,0.512

Contemporary art museum is worth a visit also.  I had no problems with English and very basic Spanish  so I would imagine good Spanish would only be a bonus.

I would do Park Guell in the morning and sagrada familia in the afternoon. As others have said Park Guell was underwhelming and not worth it (in my opinion) but do what you want. I wore a short sleeve shirt and skirt that went a little lower than mid-thigh and was good for sagrada familia. As long as your not in short shorts and a string tank top  I think you'll be alright.  Most people speak spanish as well as catalan (and many speak english as well) but i would definitely recommend trying your spanish before reverting to english  they really appreciate it!  Bar Lobo near las ramblas is awesome! Go there! Great drinks and food.  Montjuic was mentioned previously and I recommend that as well. They have a set of cable cars that has a pretty ride and will take you to around to the top.  Another thing we thought was cool was the L'Aquarium. It was nice to escape the heat and see the marine life (they have a really awesome shark tunnel). It didn't take too long to go through (1-2 hrs max) and me and my boyfriend had a great time.  Also the beach kinda sucked (hard gravel-like sand/rocks and super crowded) so if you're going to the islands after I would say skipping it is the right decision.  Happy Travels!,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.26791294642857144,102461,

I’ve heard Casa Mila sunset on the roof is spectacular but I didn’t personally go  - Las Ramblas sucks. super touristy in the nasty way that many European cities can be at their worst. although we did find some great restaurants nearby  I wouldn’t spend any other time there  - parts of the beach area suck too  if you insist on the beach go as far north up in the city as possible to avoid tourist traps and huge crowds (ie. Platja de Bogatell)  - Vinitus for the trendiest/best tapas in the city. will be close to where you’re staying in Eixample. apparently Cervesería Catalana is also great  - La Sagrada Familia is unbelievably packed but worth it  make sure you get tickets ASAP. try to get tickets that include a trip up one of the towers  that was my favorite part,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.19340277777777776,102462,

I'm excited to see the architecture and wander the streets  and maybe go to a museum or two if they're really worthwhile.

I plan to go to Casa Batllo  La Sagrada Familia  Parque Guell  and would like to walk around the Gothic Quarter  Las Ramblas/La Boqueria.

Does it make sense to visit these two places on the same day? I'm currently thinking of going to Sagrada Familia early in the morning so it won't be too crowded.

With the rapid deprecation of 747s it's hard to say what you will have available since it sounds like you really want to fly a 747.  If you are looking at the two 747 options today though I'd pick BA from a math standpoint. For main cabin BA is 31"" pitch and 17.5"" width. LH is 31"" pitch but only 17.1"" width. That's quite a narrow seat for 9 hours. If you splurged for premium though LH is 38"" pitch and 19"" width while BA is 0.5"" narrower.

Another option would be to take the Skytrain/Bus down to Stanley park and renting a bike - there's lots of breathtaking views and one of my favourite activities to do in the summer (driving there is possible but downtown traffic and parking can be a pain). As for hiking there's not that many that you can fit into an evening but since you are in Burnaby you can considering heading to the nearby lakes for a run.

726,obake1,Did I just lose out on my money for my flight booking...,So here's the background:  - booked a flight with expedia with one connecting flight from SFO -> LAX -> NRT round trip under one ticket/itinerary (Singapore and Alaska) - got an email saying return flight from NRT -> LAX got changed and had some proposed times and a 3rd option to request a refund - called expedia to request the refund and was told it was guaranteed since the change was out of my control and wasn't me that initiated it.  It's been about a month and I have to call them week after week to follow up on this and every time I have to re-explain the same story to a different person and it's becoming extremely frustrating that they keep giving me run around answers and no one seems to know what's going on except having to re-open email after email with Singapore since apparently that's the only way they operate is through email. Finally today  an agent told me Singapore denied the claim for a refund.  With that said  was I just flat out lied to initially by expedia? I was told that an involuntary change does allow me to request a refund. Do I just eat the loss on that entire booking?

Thanks!,self,No video,2019-07-15 18:57:39,13.0,0.0,1.0,4_seasons_in_one_day,You mean parties with booze  right? Ok  read on...  If you are staying in Maafushi  then go on a day trip to Club Med Kani  they have crazy parties over there  they are sometimes open to day trippers. Other day tripping resorts with parties are Paradise Island and one of the Adaaran resorts  I think they are open to day trippers. But my best bet would be Club Med Kani.  Hotels on Maafushi organize day trips to resorts  so ask if it's possible to join a resort party at night. Just be forewarned  if you do it  then your group will have to pay for a private speedboat transfer. Partying gets very expensive very quickly in the Maldives.  A cheaper option would be the hotel by the airport (Hulhule Airport Hotel)  there are also parties over there. You don't have to be booked into that hotel to enter their bars  but if you do  be prepared that you may have to hang around Male until the morning. Or pay for a private speedboat back to Maafushi (expensive!)   The cheapest option would be to stay on Maafushi and party there - there is a floating bar there that serves alcohol and that's the sole party spot. Arena Hotel has parties by the bikini beach  but no alcohol served there. However  they are still crazy (even though booze free).,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",-0.015444862155388468,102547,

If you don't mind a 2 minute walk to the beach and prefer a very laid back atmosphere (VERY laid back  but still great service and good food) and like to make friends with your fellow travelers  AND affordable (so you can spend your money on other things  like booze)  then Stingray Beach Inn is a good option. It's owned by the same guy that owns Triton Beach Hotel and Spa and you can take advantage of their super cheap excursions.    But if you prefer more posh and classy surroundings  the Arena is the go-to place.   Though  basically  no matter where you are staying  you can pretty much walk into any of the larger hotels and have breakfast  or join their dinner buffet (as long as you pay  of course)  it's all very incestuous on Maafushi.

How to best spend my time?,Most sane people would probably choose an area and stick to it  but I think I want to do a road trip sometime between Nov and Feb. (I am aware of the distances between cities!). I'm just not entirely sure where to go because there's something that interests me in every territory.   So given a 2 week time frame  in which direction should we drive from Sydney to get the most out of our trip? Keep in mind I'm not afraid of driving to Perth if I think it's going to be worth it. One relevant thing is that neither me or my SO have a big interest in cities. Yes  I'd love to see them  but I don't need to spend more than a day or two before moving on. I'm also not picky about food  so I'm just as happy eating at an expensive restaurant or a truck stop. I like admiring landscapes (especially beaches or something I can't get in the states/is unique to the country I'm visiting)  eating at local diners  off the beaten path towns  and being active when not in a vehicle. I'm also not bothered by oppressive heat and I'm willing to avoid certain areas if tourist season makes them unbearably crowded.   Any suggestions?   I'm still open to flying between cities but I want to explore the road trip idea first.,self,No video,2019-07-15 12:27:03,5.0,1.0,2.0,st4ntz,First thing to keep in mind is school is finished early dec to late Jan (summer holidays) and anywhere near a beach will be packed.   That said  I’m interested to know what kind of interests you had in the various states  and what kind of landscapes you’d like to encounter?   Just based on what you’ve said  national parks and beaches seem to be the go and weave a few together  so royal national park near syd  going north you have tea gardens/ hawks nest  then the mid north coast (great lakes / booti booti)  going up to coffs then byron bay  to the Gold Coast (lamington np is worth a visit inland on the end of that route). Plenty of parks and beaches on and off that track  it’s also a main highway so no real challenging drives  although some of those places can be a bit off the highway. Then you could hop a plane to far north qld and enjoy the gbr and surrounds. If that’s too much beach  could go up through the hunter valley (wine region) from Newcastle and up through tamworth and then back to the coast. No shortage of options really...,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.17500000000000002,102567,

757,bernicer95,Machu Picchu Inca Trail - workout tights vs. Hiking pants,I am doing the 2D Inca Trail from July 28-29. I am one who prefers the flexibility and no chaffing from workout leggings  but my mother insists on buying hiking pants to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes. Now I know that it is the dry season and that mosquitoes are hardly found at high altitudes  so are workout tights worn with high socks and regular hiking shoes fine for this trek? Thanks!,self,No video,2019-07-15 08:36:02,7.0,2.0,0.0,Bay2NPS2NFS2BLM2Sac,Hiking pants won't really prevent mosquitoes from biting you. Baggy clothing kinda works when moving  but there are still parts that will be tight against your skin (butt  thighs  shoulders) that the mosquitoes will find.  The best way to make clothing mosquito-proof is to treat it with Permethrin.  In general  I find baggy clothing to keep me cooler in more arid climates  whereas shorts and tights are better for more humid ones. Just make sure your leggings have a tight enough weave if you're worried about sun protection. UV at altitude ain't a joke.  Mosquitoes definitely can live at altitude though as long as they have water for breeding. I've had mosquito hell at high altitude alpine lakes and streams in the Western US.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.2092813852813853,102570,0.218

Alternatively  IIRC the hop on/hop off bus goes by Dublin airport and you can buy a 24h tickets.

I’m still researching it more but from reading a free handout brochure at my hostel it seems there’s 10 main attractions  I’m fine not visiting Qasr Tuba and the Oasis near Azraq so that should leave 8 ‘castles’ to see if I got to see them all.

It's close to tube station. Close to Buckingham palace or westminster Abbey.   The lobby is incredible  they have a bee hive on the 2nd or 3rd floor make their own honey.  They grow their own veggies in the roof top garden. Try the afternoon tea. They also offer free wine tasting daily (get smashed)...    The morning breakfast is surreal for authenticity... the laundry mat is a short walk (next to bar to drink and the morgue if you pass away)   The staff is 4 stars quality. BUT the rooms are not immaculate (creaky wooden floors) but it was built in 1800s.

Most of the LCCs don't operate from Heathrow  it tends to be flag carriers mostly.  You can get a cheap flight to Nyköping in the evening from Stansted  it's not the easiest transfer from Heathrow but its not terrible either. You can either take the trains (Heathrow Express/regular to Paddington then tube to London Liverpool Street for the Stansted Express) or arrange a taxi between the airports.  Edit: just looked and there is a direct bus between the 2 airports run by National Express.  You need to factor in about 5-6 hours for transfer  Heathrow can be a pain to get out of and you will of course have to go through immigration but Stansted is an OK airport to get through.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.4714285714285715,102691,0.049

Goblin Valley is also about the same distance and is absolutely otherworldly.   If you want to stay a little closer to Salt Lake City I would recommend Park City (with the Olympic Park)  Little Cottonwood canyon (hiking and climbing) or Mt. Timpanogos. You can do the cave on Timp but I would recommend the summit trail. It's a long day but if you can make it to the summit  its definitely worth it. If you are feeling crazy you can start at midnight for the sunrise from the peak. Either way come prepared.   In SLC try the Red Iguana  the Kathmandu  or Lucky 13.

894,Pursuit_of_Hoppiness,Traveling to Salt Lake City looking for suggestions on things to do,I’m travel from South Florida to SLC next week with my husband and kids and have 9 days total. We are a very outdoorsy family and have hiked  caved  etc all over Europe  Central America and the US even with the kids. We have two days unaccounted for. Most of the time will be spent in Yellowstone with a stop in Jackson Hole. Does anyone have any suggestions on something to do in Salt Lake? I’m not really seeing anything I’m dying to do. We are kicking around the idea of making the drive to Zion National Park. Pictures I have seen look amazing. Would the drive be worth it or would our time be better spent elsewhere?

895,Eki75,Baggage restrictions,I’m about to go on a 3+month trip through Europe  and I’m nervous about keeping my backpack under 10kg for the flights.  When do they weigh?  At the check in or at the boarding gate?  If it’s the former  can I wear all of my heavy stuff through security and then change clothes and repack my backpack before boarding the plane?

You will also want to keep liquids to a bare minimum  so pack empty containers that you can fill up at hostels /  guest houses / hotels  etc.  I'm about 2 months into a year and a half trip with my wife and we have a total of 25 kgs in total  with next to no clothes. The majority of our weight is in recording and editing equipment  so 10 kgs is definitely doable.  The other big consideration will be clothing and footwear. That will depend heavily on the season and climate of the region  but I would still say to try to keep yourself to two full outfits that can be mixed and matched and then maybe pick up cheap replacements along the way.   Get your bags to 10kgs total. Airlines with strict limits absolutely check if your bag looks on the heavy side. It's a real damn pain to be honest. Southeast Asia has limits of 7kg for a lot of flights and it makes us want to pull our hair out! How the hell do the expect anyone to get under 7kgs?! We always end up having to put everything heavy in one backpack and checking it. 😭  Anyway  best of luck!,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.10218253968253968,102708,0.1

There are a ton of day trips that you can do from there that are absolute musts but I don't know how long you will be there. In Zurich itself  get down to the Bellevue area and start walking around by the water. It's a fantastic area and way better than the Banhofstrasse. You can do a short train ride for about $20 up to Utelyberg for some great vies of the city from above. Otherwise  day trips I would recommend Lauterbrunnen (and if time  a stop in Interlaken on the way and take some time in Bern on the way back). Another great trip would be to Stanz and ride in the funicular to the top of Stanzerhorn and maybe stop in Luzern on the way back. Get an early start and you can get to Zermatt and back in a day. Take the train from Zermatt city up for closer views of the Matterhorn. Rhine Falls is also not to far and is quite a site.  The information desk at the main train station in Zurich is fantastic. They will help you figure out schedules  tracks and look for discounts on prices for you. When we were there 2 months ago  they told us about special passes at the post office that let us go anywhere in Switzerland for 24 hours for $55. Considering the train from Zurich to Lauterbrunnen is $155  that was a great deal. Also  if you already have tram passes to get around Zurich  they will take money off of your train tickets for you.

I'll be arriving on the 2nd September and staying in Neuchatel first  then Zurich from the 7th. I have no limit of interests so all suggestions are welcome.,self,No video,2019-07-15 08:02:14,14.0,0.0,13.0,travel_ali,I know it is your opinion.

Expect your accommodations to be very  very expensive. Airbnb is heavily regulated in Japan so your options are pretty limited as well. You'll want to find something sooner rather then later  especially if you can't afford the $4-500/night price range. I stayed in a private room in a hostel in Downtown Vancouver during the 2010 Olympics for something like $150/night  if you manage to find anything that cheap for Tokyo during the Olympics  jump on it.  Getting around shouldn't be hard. Subway trips within the city range from 120 or so Yen up to 300ish IIRC  fares are calculated by distance so a short trip is cheaper than a long one. The trains in Japan are very orderly and there are plenty of staff around to help out  this'll probably be even more apparent during the Games. Just be aware that there are a couple of companies that operate trains in Tokyo and fares don't transfer between different companies. If you want to leave Tokyo during your stay  look into getting a JR pass for unlimited rides for a certain amount of time. It wouldn't be worth it if you were staying in the city  but a round trip ride to Kyoto or Osaka will pretty much cover the cost.  The other option would be to stay in a smaller city with a short train ride into Tokyo. You'll probably save a ton on hotel costs but you'll lose a bit of time commuting every day.  You can get by on about $30-40USD per day for food in Tokyo  even a little less if you don't drink. Even cheap convenience store food is very good.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.08275345622119815,102732,0.0

I'm not from Tokyo but travel there from the US a lot and love the country.  There's a lot of moving parts to figure out but first and foremost is if there are specific events you want to see then figure out where and when those are to work backwards from. Second  do you have an idea how many days you want to stay? Third  is $3000 your budget including airfare  tickets  lodging  food  and souvenirs?  &#x200B;  **Where in Tokyo**  Tokyo is a very large city and it can take a lot of time to move from one side to another. Here is a good start to understand the areas. - [https://trulytokyo.com/tokyo-olympic-venues/](https://trulytokyo.com/tokyo-olympic-venues/) or [https://tokyo2020.org/en/games/venue/olympic/](https://tokyo2020.org/en/games/venue/olympic/)  * Gymnastics will be at the Ariake Gymnastics Centre in the Tokyo Bay Zone * Track will be at the Olympic Stadium in the Heritage Zone near Shinjuku  &#x200B;  **When**  Per the [IOC schedule](https://tokyo2020.org/en/games/schedule/olympic/) Track events will be from 31 July to 8 August. Women's uneven bar finals are 2 August. For gymnastics I can't see which of the qualifying events are for uneven bars prior.  &#x200B;  Overall  with this sort of timeline for events I would center your trip around arriving no later than 31 July to adjust to the time shift from MD. This gives you a day to relax then events between 2 August and 8 August as you see fit. For accommodations most of the hotels that have shown availability are running over $400/night. If a dedicated room is too expensive for you with your budget you can consider staying in a capsule hotel for that duration. My last trip I stayed at two different First Cabin hotels. These are technically capsule hotels but offer a good amount of space for a solo traveler. Airfare schedules also have not yet been released to give you guidance there. You should begin to see airfare become available in about 2 months since it's currently available through 7 June 2020.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.16456043956043953,102733,

I finally booked for $800 and a slightly less convenient itinerary instead.  It was just confusing because Kayak had identified a United/Lufthansa flight that couldn't be found for that price at either airline's sites.    Then I looked into some past complaints about justfly.com  who books on behalf of Kayak  and I see that others have had problems with them before with them coming back a day or two later and saying that they couldn't book your flight.  So I'm going to chalk it up to the flight no longer existing for that price.  Thanks for your help.  On a separate note  United/Lufthansa codesharing is a mess.  You can book with one or the other  but they have difficulty guaranteeing that you can pay for your luggage for both legs together.  Also  I bought on United  but they directed me to Lufthansa wanting $35+ for seat assignments.

Yes  but when I checked Lufthansa to try to get the same deal I had found  they said that they could not collect baggage fees for any of the United-operated flights  so I would have to wait to pay for those at the check-in desk.  Ultimately  I ended up booking through United  which apparently had no problem arranging my baggage for the Lufthansa-operated flights too.  > As for seating assignments  with codeshare flights it's quite normal to have to get assigned seating with the airline that is operating your flight (eg. when I book Air Canada/United codeshares I have to select seating with each respective airline after I book)  But I disagree that when buying a United flight  I should have to pay Lufthansa additional fees to reserve seats in advance when the United class I'm buying includes seat selection for free.  (This was for any seat  not just premium seats).  So ultimately  I have a United ticket but no Lufthansa seats since I refuse to pay $45 extra for a non-premium seat.  As I mentioned in another comment  the FTC should crack-down on this bullshit.  Ultimately  a $650 flight is at least $850 if you want luggage and to pick a seat.  I understand the arguments for allowing some people to forgo benefits they don't want  but there should be a check-box to choose what you want in advance and then compare like-for-like.  Any arguments that consumers are benefited by this complication and confusion is just a disingenuous argument by the airline lobbies.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.027272727272727282,102845,

Usually what happens is that they book you into the same class/whatever is available but sometimes the same class can have different benefits on different airlines. I do wish they would book like-for-like benefits but that will probably result in codeshare flights being extremely expensive.

Thank you for any advice and suggestions.,self,No video,2019-07-15 05:46:34,13.0,1.0,4.0,EternoOttimista,I studied abroad in London and have made a bit of a guide for friends who go visit - here's a section that might be useful.    South Kensington/Hyde Park   This is the area that I lived in when I studied abroad and although it’s really posh  it’s got all of the museums (all free) and Hyde Park only a 5-10 minute walk away. South Kensington or Knightsbridge are probably the best Tube Stop for you to go to for this area. Knightsbridge is right next to the world famous Harrods which is definitely worth exploring although everything in there is crazy expensive it’s still fun to walk around in. South Kensington station is a bit closer to all of the museums though so whatever you’re feeling you can pick  or just stop by one then tube to the other.      Sidenote #1   Pub food is just generally not very good. I would absolutely recommend going out to pubs to drink and watch soccer games or just to hangout at but just be warned that your average pub food is not going to be what you want to have for dinner.     Piccadilly   Picadilly is a cool area that I would probably recommend if you wanted to see a play while you’re in London (I got last minute tickets to Les Mis last time I was there and it was fantastic). There’s a ton of theaters and we saw some cool shows over there  plus its right next to London’s Chinatown district which has some decent food (and oddly enough a few decent Irish Pub’s - O’Neills and Waxy O’Connor’s)      Trafalgar Square/Westminster   This is probably one of the most iconic areas of London and a must-do. If you like a little bit of history I would 100% recommend visiting the Churchill War Rooms. It’s the center of operations that the British government essential ran out of during WWII and is very close to 10 Downing Street (Residence of the Prime Minister and about halfway between Trafalgar and Westminster). The London Eye is absolutely worth it  even if just for some sweet pics with Parliament in the background  but definitely walk around Westminster Abbey and take in the sights.    Trafalgar Square is an amazing sight to see and isn’t a far walk from Westminster  plus you have the National Portrait Gallery which I’m not completely sure if it costs money to get into but is another cool museum if you are into that kind of thing.     Sidenote #2   I used to work in this area so if you are getting really hungry near Westminster but feel the energy to take a short stroll then walk Southwest down Victoria Street until you hit Strutton Ground (turn left). They always had a really cool food market with all sorts of stuff that I would go eat lunch at almost every day when I was interning  lot’s of choices.     Other Attractions of Note  Shakespeare’s Theatre  London Tower  Buckingham Palace  St. Paul’s Cathedral  Paddington Station   Regents Park  Abbey Road  King’s Cross (Notable spot for taking a Harry Potter picture with Platform 9 3/4)  The Shard (Best view in the whole city)   Final Note: London is huge. The Tube is relatively easy to use and is way more reliable/consistent than any other public metro rail I’ve had to deal with  so you can get around pretty easily. You’re going to have a great time but don’t just stick to my list - go out and explore because there really is so much to see.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.1734120783730158,102865,

Do you know what it's like to wait in line for same day tickets to visit the Vatican Museums? Unfortunately availability is all booked up during my visit and I cant imagine taking possibly my only trip to Rome without seeing them.  For what it's worth  I really don't mind waiting in lines to see cool things  I've heard that you're often stuck with an hour long wait but to me that seems worth it. Is the hour wait time usually about right? I've also read that waiting until near closing times makes the wait for tickets shorter  but I dont want a rushed experience. I'd rather just take my time and appreciate the art.  These same points of advice can also be applied for seeing the Accademia in Florence  if you don't mind of course :),,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.13290816326530613,102894,

Sometimes however it's actually cheaper and faster to use a low-cost airline to fly within Europe  even considering the time you'll spend getting to/from airports.  Personally I'd open up Google Maps  check the location of the places you definitely want to visit  and then see if you can join them up with other places – maybe taking a train between a few cities  and then flying on somewhere else. It really depends how extensively you want to explore Europe.  If you're just aiming for the places you've listed  I'd go:  *Fly into London*   *London > Paris train*   *Paris > Germany flight*   *Germany > Austria/Switzerland > Italy train*   *Fly out of Italy*  Finding stuff 'off the beaten path' is really something you should be looking at weeks before you travel  or even when you've arrived  rather than this far in advance. Cities change so much  new places open and close  that it's kind of a waste of time planning that amount of detail right now. It's certainly worth making a note of the more touristy and sightseeing things you want to do in advance  and then filling in the gaps when the time comes.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.2481626328217237,102915,

There's also the Henry Ford Museum just Outside of Detroit Michigan  Which is one of the biggest and best American history museums in existence. The place is incredible  should definitely be high on your list (Detroit is worth seeing too! There's a ton of interesting art installations and galleries and trendy restaurants and it's beginning to have a little revival.)  Ottawa and Montreal are both worthwhile. The Canadian History Museum in Ottawa might be particularly worthwhile for non Canadians to learn a bit about Canada. There are a bunch of other Museums and parks in Ottawa to see as well. It's our Capital  so it's quite pretty and got a lot going on.  If you like the outdoors  you should see Algonquin Park and Muskoka. There's a really good visitor centre at the park that explains it's unique geography (which is wackier and more interesting than you might think) and you might see a moose or a bear on the drive there. The cruises on the bigger Muskoka lakes are great for seeing all the celebrity homes (it is secretly a big getaway for them - as big as the Hamptons - but more hush hush). On the way up to that Georgian Bay area  you could stop at St. Marie among the Hurons which is a really unique historical site that will teach you a bit about some of our indigenous peoples and early colonial history. Georgian Bay is particularly gorgeous. Ruggedly beautiful.   Once you've seen some of our northern nature  and are back in Toronto  do make a daytrip to the McMicheal gallery! It's in a cute little town an hour north of the city and it showcases Canadian artists - especially the Group of Seven who liked to paint the landscape of places like Georgian Bay and Algonquin park.   That's a good start. It's a big area. Probably much  much  much bigger than you think. There are six million people. in the GTA (Greater Toronto Area). You could fit almost two Frances inside of Ontario alone. I honestly think you could spend a whole month just exploring Toronto itself.

I would also reconsider renting a car  while switching sides of the road can be stressful  there are a lot of great things to see in Ontario that just arent  accessible by public transit.  &#x200B;  Edit: also Chicago is relatively close  and definitely worth a visit!,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.31666666666666665,102930,

Just make sure you have all your documentation (make photocopies if needed just in case) and get documentation from the hospital as soon as possible (it will be useful for CBSA and any insurance claims down the road).

To allow for even one day in theory getting you able to fly on Monday the cheapest options will be out of Charlotte (CLT) flying to Vancouver (YVR). Round-trip flights are running around $360 round trip + bags with travel time around 8 hours. Victoria BC is a small airport and a bit north of the city anyway hence it's more expensive to fly all the way there.  The cheapest to Victoria is around $503 but that's 19 hours of travel. In that extra time I would advise still flying to Vancouver and then catching the BC Ferries connector bus that will take you directly from the Vancouver airport to downtown Victoria without transfer. This is $81 CAD (\~$62 US) per person for the journey over. If you brought carry on only this would mean around $484 round trip from NC.  An alternate option is to fly to Seattle and then take the Victoria Clipper ferry from downtown right into the inner harbor. This will be a more expensive option around $484 for airfare plus $119 each way for the ferry. The benefit though is you can get all the way to Seattle without the need of a passport giving you some time.  &#x200B;  I have not searched for MD flights but starting to illustrate some options.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.12709627329192547,102959,

I’m curious of your edit  the flight was recorded  the passenger manifest was recorded  the staff and delayed flight was recorded. It wouldn’t take a genius in that Airline to see your complaint is water tight.   Give it a shot. Maybe you will get a free ticket  which you clearly deserve  or more. Best of luck and safe  happy travels in your future!  Edit: saw you answered someone else in that you don’t recall the flight. All you need is the airline and a rough time frame. They can pull your flight information  regardless if they tell you they can’t.

I can see why an attendant might say that as an explanation (because it’s true  whether or not it’s your fault as could be construed from the wording) because she’s been dealing with irate customers and that’s what happened and people can’t really argue with that.  I don’t think she necessarily meant to single you out as being to blame for the delay  just that this is what happened  and now we’re moving. She might well not have even considered your reaction to that or if she did  not understood it might be a negative reaction.  Of course  as a professional she should know better  but I don’t think you can assume it’s malicious. I could see myself saying something like this when I worked in customer service and not really realising how it might make the person feel.
