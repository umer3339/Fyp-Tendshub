Shame on you!  Moving on... I used to have a current account in Bank Alfalah a few years ago and it was alright. The customer service was great  as a matter of fact. They opened my account within 48 hours  which is more than I can say for most banks around here. Not sure about their current status  however.  Right now  I've an account in Meezan Bank. Another great bank  great service. The only complaint I've is that they charge a bit too much on international VISA transactions (\~4%). But that's about it.  >HBL  Don't get me started on HBL! Please don't...  My brother has an HBL account. And it's the third worst bank in my experience  only behind National Bank and MCB Bank.  The staff simply DOES NOT care about you  it's that simple. They act as if they're government employees  which says a lot in my book!,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.0767857142857143,99602,

In Bhutto's time Pakistan was put on an embargo by the Americans due to India's misadventures towards nuclear armament thus causing us to look for a better defense alternatives as well. (Bhutto should've really thought it over before calling it the Islamic Bomb)  Come Zia  Pakistan was again blessed with the aid of our all weather allies in America and the West (forgetting there existed a nuclear embargo) when the Soviet finally did step into Afghanistan and took hold. With the aid of Americans and the Saudis  under Zia  Pakistan heavily invested in the Jihadist proxies  as a direct consequence the the number of madrassah or religious institutes which numbered around ~3000  mushroomed to more than 30 000.  Geneva accord signed and the Soviets  no more a threat in '88. The Western powers quickly remembered Pakistan was working on it's own nuclear program to match India's. Bam. The restrictions are back on.  That day untill 2018. No such strides in foreign policy Pakistan can boast of. Infact much of Pakistan's foreign policy has indeed been wartime policy thus giving the impression that the army controls all aspects of it.  Not to say there hasn't been any milestones along the way. The Simla Agreement post the '71 war (in hindsight much less of an achievement since the very govt that represented Pak  Bhutto's  in that agreement was the one which directly played a role in Pak's break-off into two)  diplomacy and cordial relations with China have been our cornerstone achievement since that is perhaps the only relationship in which we've mostly always net gained  the Saudi's also have been our financial backers for most of our history (at a coast).  Talking of the current govt. We haven't had so many successive diplomatic back and fourths by so many countries since memory serves.  Of course  most of them Pakistan went to because we were in need of financial aid to bridge reserves gap. But these have proved more fruitful as positive impact can already be seen by the growth in foreign tourism  MoU's with many multinationals to open shop in Pak  also Pak signed an extradition treaty with Great Britian so that's a first.  But most of these positives heavily rely on a stable economy which unfortunately Pakistan is no where near achieving  quite the opposite in fact;  Inflation at an all time high  so is economic uncertainty due to govts weak and subject-to-immediate change policies  manufacturing and foreign exports we've next to nothing off etc etc.  It's a rollercoaster ride and a mixed bag tbh.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.10364177489177487,99878,

First  he came in unbelievably unprepared. If you compare PML-N’s first 90 days to PTIs first 90 days  the difference is staggering. PML looked like they’d been planning for this day for the last 10 years.  They came in and executed with ruthless efficiency. For every issue  they had a plan  and they went about it  beautifully. The problem they had was they faltered once the first 6 months were done  but also they’re sometimes too politically savvy for their own good.   Imran Khan on the other hand  was an idiot. What was the point of all the auctions and all that other shit at the PM house. Living in a 2 bedroom house. Medina ki Riasat. He was married to those ideas and the government wasted valuable time implementing that junk instead of making the economy its primary priority.  Second  in my opinion  his economic policy is badly flawed. Austerity  does not work. We have plethora of evidence of this from the last recession. Greece tried it and failed miserably. Almost went bankrupt in the process. Spain tried it and quickly had to reverse it. Many other European examples.  He’s a good  honest man  I hope he succeeds. But so far  he’s been a massive disappointment. Dude has had since 97 to plan for the day he would eventually take power  and dude had no plan.

But that's going by the Neo-liberal trajectory the state is on. Pre-elections  the PM promised socialist changes and instead of applying progressive socialist policies his government did what Pakistan always does  went to the IMF and got Pakistan stuck in another Neo-liberal debt trap. The PM pre-elections promised he wouldn't give tax amnesty to anyone and yet when his sister was accused of financial wrongdoings he suddenly decided to announce a tax amnesty scheme. the Federal Board of Revenue has stated that these schemes always lead to 80% less recovery. Instead of trying to expand the tax base (the number of people paying taxes)  the government is taxing the existing tax base to death. the taxes on goods are even higher than they ever were. The price of flat bread (roti) has doubled which does affect the poor no matter what the middle class or above people on this sub say to you. Two companies have stopped production of their vehicles since the price of their cars have shot up so much with the new taxes that on one seems to be buying the old stock. The property market is down  the cost of production is at an all time high and there is very little incentive to invest.     Regarding human rights  don't even ask. The government appointed a man who rammed a metal rod into his servant's ass to the Human Rights ministry. The man WAS NOT acquitted by the court but rather used his power and influence to settle with the victim out of court. The state is constantly censoring anything it dislikes  journalists are asked to self-censor. As an academic  I write on and off for a particular newspaper and I've been asked to self-censor so the state doesn't set its sights on our paper.      However  regarding diplomatic relations  the Foreign Minister is a very experienced diplomat. He was an excellent foreign minister back when he was a PPP member an he's an excellent FM now. Between him and the military (the military has always had a strong stake in Pakistan's foreign policy)  they have definitely improved Pakistan's diplomatic relations. Also  credit where credit it due  PM IK during escalating tensions between India and Pakistan handled the crisis much better and much more maturely than India's PM Modi did. So that's it in a nutshell. Now I'll just await all the downvotes and the many many angry replies by pro PTI people I'm going to get who pretend to  but really do not care about the poor in Pakistan.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.06794466239778739,99884,

The laboratories are one of the largest science and technology institutions in Pakistan  and conduct multidisciplinary research and development in fields such as national security  space exploration  and supercomputing.While the laboratories remain highly classified  the KRL is most famous for its research  development  and production of Highly-Enriched Uranium (HEU)  using gas centrifuge (Zippe-type) technological methods roughly based on the model of the Urenco Group—the technology brought by Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan  who worked there as a senior scientist.  Since its inception  there has been a large number of employed technical staff members with majority being physicists and mathematicians  assisted by engineers (both army and civilians)  chemists  and material scientists.  ***  ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/pakistan/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.12306878306878308,99974,

Your personal space is very limit; family thinks they have a right to interfere in your life (specially if they are older). It doesn't matter what age you are.  It's good in the sense that you have a lot of family support around you but very toxic in other areas.  Again  it depends entirely on your own family. My family is very individualist type and it surprises people when I tell them I don't know what my brother  living in a different country  is upto this week. We don't talk so regularly and then they go ""hawwww but he's your elder brother. Wo busy hain tou ap phone kiya karo"". I mean  wtf? We're both grown ass men.  It's also toxic because people don't learn to be independent. That's why you commonly see 30 year old ~~larkay~~ men who don't know how to prepare a basic meal  how to do the laundry  or even how to budget because they are still reliant on their parents for it. And one major criteria these parents look for when they look for a bride for their mama's boy is: sughar larki ho; i.e. she knows how to do household chores because their nikamma son cannot even do the dishes or iron his clothes.  Sorry i went on a bit of a rant. But being so close to family is indeed toxic. We confuse controlling your family members to be what emotional closeness is... while the two are very far apart.

While what I will say may sound controversial  note well that this is not exclusive to Pakistan  but to societies where humans live  everywhere.   From what I understand  or deduce  your problem seems to me like a practice  or rather habit  that is not uncommon amongst the middle class (in virtually all societies). While the implementation of these characteristics in the middle class may vary from culture to culture and society to society  they really come to the fore when there is a shift in civilization. By civilization  what I mean is  distinguishing the western and eastern civilization (an accumulation of several societies and cultures in a bigger hub). Therefore  for example  you may be able to assuage the effects of gossip  backlash  scandal in a society like England by ignoring it  or ameliorating in some form or manner  and you may be able to do the same in say  France or Germany  for instance. All of this because while there may be cultural differences and distinguishing social factors  the groundwork for all of their cultures and societies is found upon one basis—which is the western civilization  as it stands today.   However  once you move to Pakistan  as is the case here  things are different. Your understanding of the middle class and your strategies to deal with it is founded upon an exposure to a middle class in a different civilization. As such  it isn’t a one-size-fit-all solution that you may be able to implement in Pakistan. You’ll have to contrive new methods that are more amenable to the society and culture of Pakistan  and to the broader eastern civilization.   Lastly  I want to add why I use the middle class to break this apart. For one  and using a western term actually  they equate to the bourgeoisie  who have been known for eons to behave in the way you describe (perhaps in manners that differ  but the essence remains the same). However  the dictates of tradition  and those who follow them  are able to better thrive the environment in Pakistan by not paying heed to the negativity around them (it’s difficult to do  but not impossible). Despite that  tradition is continuing to disappear amongst the bulk of the population (and  by statistically defined models of population  the bulk is usually understood as the middle class—an average of sorts). But  if you observe  well-educated individuals  regardless of class  and those with respect for their own culture—while I do not discount the troubles they may face—are able to better navigate these issues  for they understand the difference between a world that is detached from their in virtually every detail of culture and social practices. For instance  I could belong to a very traditional  conservative  and religious family  but my treatment and tolerance of them does not bother me because they have maintained acting upon an inheritance which has been passed down to them generation upon generation. If my worldview differs from theirs  it is only because I spent time in a civilization which is different in many aspects. And  while I may enjoy the practices of what I have absorbed from my experience  I can’t reasonably expect those in my family  who haven’t moved an inch in their lives  to learn about those practices.  One other example I will present to illustrate my point is immigration. Pakistanis who immigrate at an old age (probably with children) to a western culture  will hold on to the values they acquired in their younger life. Their children may be able to adopt to a different worldview than theirs  and you will often find a conflict of values. Similarly  those who are second generation immigrants (namely  born in a country different than Pakistan)  will differ even from the children in the previous scenario. Lastly  students who move to acquire an education are an interesting case. Many students will strip themselves of their culture to favor the one they have moved into  in an attempt to assimilate. Yet  many other students  whose families are prominent  well-educated  or well-established in Pakistan  will always have a sort of thread attached to them. They may or may not return to their country  but they will understand the differences in values and practice. In a way  people will often find themselves equipped to live two kinds of lives. The one they live where they are based currently  and the one they will have to live upon returning home to Pakistan.   One thing to realize is that change isn’t forbidden. But  it has to be gradual  and well-thought. Instant or fast change in a social structure will always create chaos. Most importantly  the change should be seen as an evolution. I specifically allude to the idea that a change based upon a western structure is not favorable to Pakistan. As such  the change should be a construction upon our own traditions  values and institutions (but  for which we will have to understand our own culture and its history). Enfin  though it may sound controversial  but changing our society based on the model of a western society  is in itself a sort of colonization. And  traditionalists know that  which is why many  if not most  Pakistanis will always be averse to adopting practices that find root in western models or practices.

They connect and talk to other people in the same situation. For these females its just generally other females. Now what's the easiest topic for when having a conversation? Other people! With a general overall shift towards more educated females combined with more of them having a working lifestyle. This will slowly improve. How am I so sure it'll?

Bigger the family/friends circle  Higher chances of gossip / back bitting.  There is a difference between gossip and back bitting. Gossips and Back bitting  are everywhere. Back bitting  personally  I think back bitting is the action when someone is  jealous of someone.  &#x200B;  The only difference why you feel it more in Pakistan is that in Pakistan or probably in India as well  people tend to talk in the face or like in urdu we say 'Bhigo Bhigo ker marna' (بھگو بھگو کر مارنا in [English](https://ur.oxforddictionaries.com/ترجمہ_کریں/urdu-english/بھگو_بھگو_کے_لگانا%2F_مارنا)) while in other countries  people choose not to do so.  &#x200B;  Another reason is that  individuals from other countries  and few in Pakistan  like to keep themselves busy doing office work or doing house chores or learning cool stuff or creating useful thing  while some people ( in every country) who don't get themselves busy find these back bitting and gossips as a way to pass the time.  &#x200B;  Hope this helps,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.06578947368421052,100067,

Someone of that age is not a boy and should not be treated as such but I've come across so many people almost a decade older than me that couldn't do the most basic of household tasks and who expect to have it all done for them. My family and I once visited some friends' place and the mother was chastising one of her daughters for not cleaning her brother's room. Her brother is in his late 20s and engaged. Why is he not able to clean his own room and worse  why does a girl have to do it? My mother's friends are always surprised that my brother and I cook  clean  and just generally have our shit together. We also live in separate apartments despite living far away from any other family  because we prefer our independence and personal space. Aunties usually can't comprehend that and try to shame my mother with barely veiled comments about how she and my dad raised us.  I love parts of our collectivist culture. I went through a bit of a health scare a couple years ago when I was visiting Pakistan for the summer and was in and out of hospitals  getting all sorts of tests done. Every single appointment  every test  every trip to the pharmacy  someone from the family would try to make better in some way. Whether it was taking care of booking appointments  finding the right doctor  sending someone to get the medication  there was always support. It truly felt like ""the village"" was there for me. But the village also has a lot to say about my personal life. When I was deciding on what to study and where to go for my undergrad  phuppas  chachas  and mamoos all had their opinions and I had to take those opinions into account. When I was deciding on a career path  everyone had something to say about it and still does. Some people weren't too pleased with my choices and make that known.  It's so ingrained at this point that when I make a big life decision  I literally picture in my head my parents explaining it to my extended family & aunties and try to predict what their reactions will be. ""Log kya kahenge"" will always be in the back of my mind. At the same time  despite being very independent when I'm on my own  when I go back home  I almost instantly fall into my mama's boy ways too. I've caught myself yelling ""amma  chaiiiii"" when I could very easily haul ass to the kitchen and make my own chai.",,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.13483736983736982,100080,

As someone who was born and raised outside Pakistan  the more communistic vs individualistic factors are more obvious to me. My parents have been a bit of both since while I (as a guy) was raised knowing how to do my own stuff when it came to cleaning  washing clothes  etc  they still get too involved in all the decisions of our lives that can be a bit suffocating for someone not brought up in that culture.  At the same time  I see just how many questions my relatives ask us when we go to Pakistan. Prying questions like how much salary you get  what they think about what you wear (for girls) and things you'd normally feel is too personal or not their business - and they don't even take hints when try to deflect the question with vague answers.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.17333333333333334,100082,

The majority of British Pakistanis are migrants from a small area called Mirpur near Kashmir; who migrated sometime in the 70s when a dam project there meant they would be displaced so they mass migrated. It was a large group of uneducated labour.  The UK back then needed labour  so they were very accepting.  This group is  of course  different from British Pakistanis who migrated from other areas (mainly larger cities)  because migrating now is not easy. You need to be well educated and/or highly qualified/experienced (except the spousal route).  Also fact: this is the same group that has the infamous rate of cousin marries which has been criticised a lot.  Trivia: In the last census in the UK  this group was offered the chance to ethnically classify themselves as Kashmiris  but the majority sample choose to identify as Pakistanis... hence all groups are now classed under ""British Pakistanis"".

Of course  they did it and this is why Ishaq Dar has absconded to UK.  List of Sharif Mafia's Pioneering Achievements in Corruption:  * A confidential investigation report  seen by this newspaper  says the family was worth just £150 000 in 2003 but by 2018 their total assets had grown to about **£200 million**. * ‘We noticed that someone called Manzoor Ahmed had sent a series of 13 payments from Birmingham worth £1.2 million to Shahbaz’s wife Nusrat and his sons Hamza and Suleman ’ said one investigator  who asked not to be named. ‘But who was he? He was traced through his identity card  whose number was on the forms. In the words of the report  he turned out to be ‘a small home-based tuck shop owner’ in a remote village  who scraped a living selling poppadoms. Needless to say  he had never had £1.2 million  nor travelled to England. * Another man who was said to have sent about £850 000 to Shahbaz’s family from Birmingham via HSBC was Mehboob Ali  a Lahore ‘street hawker’  who lived from taking tiny commissions from collecting old banknotes and changing them into new ones. * The investigators say payments made by this method totalled £21 million – but were merely the tip of the iceberg. They say they have traced a further £9.1 million from ‘ghost’ investors who do not exist  and fake loans and investments in family companies. Their value  they claim  amounts to a further **£160 million**. * One is the Pakistan National Cash Transfers programme  for which DFID has provided nearly £300 million since 2012  giving payments of £100 a month to mothers in poor families. Before Imran Khan became prime minister  inquiries had begun into payments to ‘ghost’ claimants which were being siphoned off – but the investigation was shut down while Shahbaz’s party was in power. It has now been reopened  and investigators are conducting a fresh survey of how the money was spent  and whether women who got the stipend actually exist.  This is what these Jahil Patwaries have to say for themselves: 😂😂😀  * Shahbaz’s son  Suleman  told the MoS: ‘This is a witch-hunt against my family. It is similar to what happened at **Guantanamo Bay**  and under **apartheid in South Africa**.’ (You cannot make this shit up!)  **The Best News Here** 👌👌😍  * Britain’s National Crime Agency is working closely with Pakistani investigators and Home Secretary Sajid Javid is discussing the possible extradition of members of Shahbaz’s family who have taken refuge in London.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",-0.020767676767676782,100239,

For a view like that in europe you are looking at £200 a night bare minimum.   Hotel with a nice infinity pool overlooking that can charge a few hundred pounds a night.  What pakistan needs to work on is:  1) Acess to these locations. It is easy to get a flight to Islamabad. But how to get to Hunza in a fast cost effective way. As someone who lives abroad i can't find reliable information on this in a quick manner  2) Activities in the area. Scenery is nice but people need to fill their itinerary. Are the activities there compelling enough for people to want to stay there for 5 days?,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.34696969696969704,100263,0.044

761,Velocity501,Hunza at night,Hi guys  I’m planning on majoring in chemical engineering and recently got into LUMS.  NUST hasnt started selecting candidates yet but im very hopeful for that too .  These are my 2 options and from a very holistic point of view I’ve always preferred LUMS for the exposure and community it offers. Recently after getting in it came to my attention that the Chemical engineering department at LUMS is not PEC accredited. Im not clearly sure how that will affect me or my degree and it is also absolutely beyond me how a department from one of the better universities in the country could not be accredited. I was told that i shouldn’t worry because the department is fully up to standards and is new and PEC will accredit it when  the first batch graduates. I googled around and couldn’t verify any of this.

There is a marked difference in at least Lahore in the skin tone of people based on their wealth and social status. Its mostly caused by wealthy/powerful men historically preferring to marry lighter skinned women  meaning their progeny is likelier to be lighter skinned  and since there is very little social mobility in this country the wealthy people over time become distinctly lighter skinned than the average person.  I dont know about anyone else but most of the women and girls from rich families I know here in Lahore are not obviously brown skinned  even though its northern punjab and they aren't from the northern areas. They're either midly tanned or they're distinctly light skinned with a skin tone not dissimilar to people in east asian countries. Add to that the fact that biologically speaking females are ligher skinned than males anyways.  These models and instagram people you are talking about are far more likely to be from wealthy privileged backgrounds and hence far more likely to be lighter skinned than the average pakistani female.  Again to reiterate  I can only speak for Lahore but the female members of upper class families here are on average not as brown skinned as the pakistani average  and in many cases are far ligher. Colourism is obviously the root cause  but not necessarily because they only pick ligher skinned models(though thats obviously true as well)  the pool they get is just more likely to be ligher skinned at the outset.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.12182291666666667,100335,

Now for the disagreements I have with mostly Hasan Nisar.   He always does this and it’s a terrible way to make your case. What he does is  he discounts our good by juxtaposing it with an unrelated vice that we have. The pseudi lib thinks  *wah kiya argument hai. Wakeyi  100 butta 100 drust baat farmaya hai*. But they fail to realize these are fallacious arguments.   He spoke about our India rivalry which he believes is started by us. When the truth of the matter is  there are unfinished issues from the time of partition that always existed. These issues were exacerbated  over the years because India and Pakistan decided to side with opposite sides of the global powers who were themselves duking it out with each other post WWII. As neighbors our interests kept diverging further to the point that India now uses our already non existent bilateral trade as a weapon of war. So those liberal economists who keep complaining about Pakistan not increasing trade with India fail to realize that we will be handing our balls to India in a vice grip by increasing trade with them. Birds eye view: we are moving further from US influence and guess who jumped in US’s lap to replace us; India. So I think Hassn Nisan needs to understand a bit more of geopolitical motivation and global influences in our region before making such comments.   He also spoke about us not being a nation  rather a disjointed crowd. I don’t see what he wants or what he’s getting at. Our base motivations across the board are the same. We all want to feed our families and practice our faiths. yup  Ahmadi  Christians and Hindus included. That’s is what nation states are. People of different ethnicities put together  just wanting to get through life. We don’t all have to be on the same page. Diversity can certainly be a strength and we have plenty of diversity within the 95% plus of this country’s Muslim population. What’s wrong with that. I also think this confused nation adage is a trope. We are all so different and yet we all are very similar. India and  Afghanistan could only wish for this level of hegemony. Which is why they struggle with exploiting our fault lines. It was much easier with Bangladesh due to us being separated from them. Even today pro Pakistan sentiments among plenty of Bangladeshis r strong but I digress. Now I wait for a pappu Indian to come and whine about *buh buh big bangladesh Hates you-*. Kek   I’ll also comment on Nisar’s kind of slave mentality. Arabs are not the owners of our religion. Their bigotry is irrelevant to the fact that Pakistani Muslims do see Islamic history as our religious history.   Lastly nisar’s  comments about our nukes but we can’t feed children. Bruh  that’s irrelevant. 2 different issues. Regardless of whether we had nukes or not those kids would be dying hungry. Thanks PPP and liberals. Not saying army and PMLN are free of blame but the worst conditions for children are undoubtedly in Sindh. Also  nukes are made to collect dust. They are a deterrent and going by the visceral hate foreign nations have for our nukes  I’d say it was the right thing to do.   Baqi ka sirf yehi kahoonga ke  Hasan Nisar is huge supporter of IK. Those who nod their heads in agreement with Nisar’s always morbid introspection shouldn’t forget that the crux of his seething criticism is that the previous leaders be brought to justice. That is what is happening rn. This will have to continue for atleast another 10 years. So yeah  the paid shill of a media who wants to pressure the state into handing out NROs to their patrons will keep getting the boot and you haramkhorz will continue to Cry.

Compare the amount of jailed journalists in Pakistan (none)  amount of journalists killed in Pakistan (2 this year  0 last year)  and whatever abducted journalists you’re talking about to 2008-2012. [Majority of the journalists killed in Pakistan since 1992 were killed during the last PPP rule](https://cpj.org/asia/pakistan/)  Speaking of this unprecedented censorship. It’s simply due to taking lollipops (ads) out of their mouths. It’s hilarious how media houses can be so entitled they complain about the government pulling ads from them. I don’t think critical stories about PPP were run even 1/20th to the amount critical stories on PTI are run  every day there was a burst of “shaheed Benazir Bhutto” bullshit on the news.   Fauj was untouchable then and it’s untouchable now  no denials there. And I legitimately believe that censorship in the media is completely restricted to army-related stories  as it’s always been. It’s foolish to claim any extra censorship as literally turning your TV on will prove you otherwise. I could pull up a hundred news articles from then about a bleak situation.   Another thing. It’s weird how you consider banning social media less censorship than banning traditional media. The latter being always controlled by a narrative around the world  whether by advertisers or governments. Really no such thing as a free traditional media. Just a lack of pockets being filled.   I hate PMLN but I do agree they were the most hands off when it came to censorship  PPP was by far the most. A military dictatorship had more media freedom than them.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.022311827956989244,100432,

Lol  * A confidential investigation report  seen by this newspaper  says the family was worth just £150 000 in 2003 but by 2018 their total assets had grown to about **£200 million**. * ‘We noticed that someone called Manzoor Ahmed had sent a series of 13 payments from Birmingham worth £1.2 million to Shahbaz’s wife Nusrat and his sons Hamza and Suleman ’ said one investigator  who asked not to be named. ‘But who was he? He was traced through his identity card  whose number was on the forms. In the words of the report  he turned out to be ‘a small home-based tuck shop owner’ in a remote village  who scraped a living selling poppadoms. Needless to say  he had never had £1.2 million  nor travelled to England. * Another man who was said to have sent about £850 000 to Shahbaz’s family from Birmingham via HSBC was Mehboob Ali  a Lahore ‘street hawker’  who lived from taking tiny commissions from collecting old banknotes and changing them into new ones. * The investigators say payments made by this method totalled £21 million – but were merely the tip of the iceberg. They say they have traced a further £9.1 million from ‘ghost’ investors who do not exist  and fake loans and investments in family companies. Their value  they claim  amounts to a further **£160 million**. * One is the Pakistan National Cash Transfers programme  for which DFID has provided nearly £300 million since 2012  giving payments of £100 a month to mothers in poor families. Before Imran Khan became prime minister  inquiries had begun into payments to ‘ghost’ claimants which were being siphoned off – but the investigation was shut down while Shahbaz’s party was in power. It has now been reopened  and investigators are conducting a fresh survey of how the money was spent  and whether women who got the stipend actually exist.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",-0.05192138779095302,100478,

All the revenue from there will go into health.  And besides  health is a provincial subject  especially the delivery of it. Federal hospitals are mainly polyclinic and PIMS  with a good chunk of the money going into administration.

For example  if you go on any Pakistani bridal page  makeup artist page  or photography page  all you see are very white models/brides. Where the heck are the brown girls? Even if more people are white skinned (which I don’t think is true except maybe in northern areas of Pakistan) there would still be brown people out there. So why are there never any brown brides? Why are there never any brown girls on any of these pages? Does everyone whiten the heck out of their clients because it’s just a thing in Pakistan?

The biggest reason is that Angus beef is not available in Pakistan and our cow breeds are sub par.  Then on top of that we make that sub par breed taste even worse because our cows are grass fed which results in a very gamey taste  same as wild cows in the West.     American Angus beef has a very mild taste and eating it raw is still as gamey as eating a rare grass fed steak and If you cook it rare is like butter already straight from Walmart into a pan.   So to make that gamey taste either you can properly marinate the shit out of the steak or overcook it as most people can't even marinate it well.  Eid is coming  try making your own steak and see if you can make that strong taste go away  its almost acidic.   Our animals are not raised and given the proper food to be enjoyed rare.   The very top restaurants in Pakistan are importing Angus and even American fast food chains are importing their patties for this sole reason.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.1621025641025641,100511,

I believe these targets were set by the outgoing pmln government...who clearly didn't know how to manage the economy. Makes for a clicknaity headline  but largely meaningless.  Also given how much our currency has depreciated and has yet to depreciate  it is understandable for export growth to be very low in the immediate short term (as it gets more expensive for businesses to invest and thus spur growth).   And so before anyone says don't depreciate: that's the only thing we can do before we are bankrupt   2.) One thing to note is that exports fell by about 25% during pmlns tenure. From zardaris departure (the absolute criminal who wasn't interested in running the country) to Abbassis  exports fell (alluding back to pmln gross incompetence).  But an important thing to understand isbwhy did this happen.   There's a talk I linked to from the current FBR chairman from 3 years ago  when he was in private practice talking of how one of the negatives of using real estate as a money laundering mechanism was the spectacular growth being seen in the market.  You could easily earn 100%+ returns on an annual basis.  And so many many wealthy closed their factories andb used the money to invest in real estate.  Real estate speculation became a haven for investment when those funds should have gone to grow the economy  they just went into a speculative bubble.  This is one of the biggest cases of economic mismanagement. That's at least 2 by my count during nawazs tenure: artificially pegging our currency that has resulted in this major mess  and basically killing investment and economic growth by not clamping down on the real estate bubble,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.08228114478114483,100558,

Prime minister lives in a house he bought illegally. He travels in luxury vehicles and has apartments in Hyatt while showing no source of income? Where is his money coming from while he claims to be philanthropist for last 20 years??   2. The revenue minister Hamad Azhar paid 6000 RS while he owns multiple million dollar vehicles. Where are his tax returns??   3. The 22 year old son of the army cheif builds a tower in Lahore with only lands value estimated to be 20 billion Pak rupees? How much taxes he has paid and what is his source of income?  4. Judges meet accused and discuss bribe amounts  acknowledge it in a legal oath  don't get arrested and only temporarily suspended.  5. The cabinet is comprised of people who were all under serious corruption investigations? Chodhry brothers  firdos ashiq  Azam Khan sawati  Faisal vawda  I mean are you kidding me??  6. A government who cannot stop tanker mafia from stealing and selling water in Karachi (requires no forgein investment just political will).  7. A government that cannot promise justice no money required just implement the law. If they can force businesses to pay taxes. Surely they can fix the judicial system.  8. While I don't have drinking water (clean or polluted) the generals and ministers are drinking Nestle from the money I paid in taxes.   I am sorry but how could any one support giving money to these the worst of all worst people on Earth?? I mean seriously.

It needs to be built gradually piece by piece just like it was built in Western Europe and Scandinavia.  Public health insurance (not free  initially mind you) and old age pensions started off in Bismarck's Germany/Prussia in 1883 and from there countries started building more.  Quality public education free-to-all paid-via-taxes only really started in Scotland in the 1600's  although one can argue that the Islamic model of free education to the poor started before that but it had a segmentation bias based on ability to pay for tuition fees and so wasn't very public.  As for transportation of subways  this started in 1863 London and expanded gradually to Paris and New York. They developed slowly and based on need in dense areas. The problem with Pakistani cities is that because many were built in the post-car era  there isn't the density of population to support subways in most cities. Karachi for example  because of it's sprawl  would be better suited to a Shanghai style mixed-modal transit with monorails for the long trips say from Bahria Town to I I Chundrigar area  and KCR coming back and being regurgitated for downtown trips  but Defence to II Chundrigar trips being by bus routes and maybe a limited subway route that connects Lyari to Saddar to Clifton to Gizri to KPT Flyover to Korangi to Shah Faisal Town to the Airport (i.e. where building density and mid to high-rises already exist  those areas could be connected via subway but you honestly can't expect a subway from Saddar to SeaView or Saddar to Malir or where an international transportation hub exists).   Even still  the government can do nothing without money and it would need to borrow more from foreigners in likely foreign-denominated debt or bolster up tax revenues through collection and imposing penalties otherwise the spending will need to just another balance of payments crisis.  If Pakistan wants to provide the services that a Top Tier country does like you demand  it NEEDS your contribution.  Also you're wrong about other countries. Atleast in my other one  the government takes a chunk from every paycheck every two weeks  and then after the end of the year I file a report with them that I need money back because for example I qualified for education tax credit or kid's fitness tax credit or medical tax credit and then they send me money back so basically I gave them a free loan for that refund amount the whole year  right? So governments everywhere do collect money first then do spending.

Caliphate legalized abortion long ago and we have forgotten about that shari'ah since it's dissolution (allowed up till khalqan aqar when Allah attaches the soul to the khalaq at 4 months after insemination).    Before that all abortions are halal as a form of birth control (for non-Malaki Sunnis) although permissible but discouraged.   As for other forms  there isn't an ijma on it currently but coitus-interruptus method is mentioned in some Hadis as a valid birth control practiced by the Prophet  and hence is Sunnah and so the cycles/rhythm method based on that popular app is likely fine as it is primarily about timing and spacing which is analogous to the rationale behind the Prophet's sunnah of pulling out but pill-based forms of birth control are likely haraam via analogy to the prohibition on altering your body (e.g. why permanent tattoos are haraam).,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.014583333333333328,100610,

My arguments are about why people don't want to pay taxes. I am not a noon league supporter or zardari supporter. I don't think I should write about defending them.   Imran Khan explained how he bought apartments in UK and how he funneled (cute word for laundering ) the money to Pakistan to avoid taxes. He did not explain how he is still making more money while not having a source of income that could justify his lifestyle. He showed some agricultural lands but also claimed that they are not productive.  The entire cabinet is a bunch of non tax payers let's start with them first. For example hafwez sheikh does not pay a single dime of taxes in Pakistan. Hamad Azhar shabbar zaidi they should make their tax returns public if they want to run a public office.   Just think for a second why majority of journalists   social activists  politicians  economists  businessmen  traders  are part of resistance??? All of them are corrupt all of them traitors???

I once saw a girl with an eyebrow piercing in Pakistan. If I remember correctly  she was from Karachi. It gave me sleepless nights for a while.  But the real question is  why do you want it?

(the feeling that you need the piercing).   I don't think that piercing is a very permanent thing either. If and when you've had your fill from it  then you can choose just to not wear anything in it  and it will be hardly noticeable.

It does not close  up once u remove the ring. Depending on how heavy the ring is and for how long u keep the ring the hole can be more prominent with out the ring. If you don’t want at some point in your professional career for people to look at that hole and think  whew this girl is freaky deaky  if you don’t want to spend the rest of your life explaining to people why that hole is there and why u stopped wearing the ring. Just don’t do it. Because you will be out of this phase in less than 2 years and you’ll have found a think you wanted to do to look cool. Wait it out. It isn’t the end of the world if you don’t get what you think you really really really need right to establish your cool credits among peers,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.1869047619047619,100702,

Just yesterday  over an [article](https://www.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/ccr6bb/how_many_are_too_many_newspaper_dawncom/)  we struck up a light convo.

He ignored  the logical arguments backed by empirical research and straight away became defensive as his personal beliefs were being challenged.  Upon my insistance of straining the argument presented in the article  his response was to derail the convo entirely using out-of-context metaphors to make-me-see his perspective and thus moving away from the core subject itself to a position where he could better respond to my questioning  which he had successfully derailed.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.2256410256410257,100880,

You need to take 12 credit hours out of SSE  and besides that you can take whichever course you want to take. After first year you are allowed to take Max 20 credit hours  which can be 5 or 6 courses. And if you want even more  you can discuss it with your advisor. If you're interested in research and further studies LUMS is a great place that can give you a taste of that in your undergrad. Many of my batch mates are in top universities of US.

It's not that big of a deal. There's the library and computer lab to study all night. That structure is for one major only. You have to take 130cr. Not all of them go towards your major  some are extras like in groups and out groups and free electives. And across majors the basic/pre req course are the same within the school. For a minor you have to take 7 courses from that discipline  you can manage them within your in groups  out groups and free electives. You pay for 130  you want to go above you pay more. It's not that difficult  you can sit with a professor and plan it out once you're done with the pre reqs or the 1st year.  You'll figure it out don't worry  relax and enjoy your time at LUMS. Join societies  take up a sport  manage your time well  look after your mental health  have good relationships with your instructors  and talk in class.

If Pakistan decides they won't pay the fine there are a lot of international investors who are willing to invest in Pakistan will either find other countries or will demand a high rate of return.  If Pakistan does not pay up or fix an arrangement to pay in instalments it will be difficult for Pakistan to take loans from foreign banks as it is also possible that Pakistan may deny returning that loan.   One may argue that Pakistan has gold and possible oil reserves but what are you going to do with those reserves when only a few countries do business with you?  You will sell those reserves cheaply to these countries who earn huge profits. Venezuela has the highest proven oil reserves even after that they are not able to do anything.   It is only wise for Pakistan to go for a payment plan and get rid of this as the higher court you go the higher the legal expenses and fines.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.09614035087719301,101061,

Dark skin is beautiful  and I honestly didn’t know this was a thing in Pakistan as far as being looked down upon.  I am half Pakistani  born in the states and not really in touch with my Pakistani side unfortunately which is why I follow this sub and once in a while read a post when it pops up on my feed here. After reading your post  I felt so compelled to respond.   Skin color is not something we have any control over. Family is supposed to support you and treat you with respect. Evidently  your family is quite the opposite. In fact  your family’s behavior toward you is emotionally abusive!  Work hard on your studies  travel in the future  you will meet so many people who don’t even see skin color. Living here in the states  for example  my group of friends come from all backgrounds  and the color of skin is not even registered. Of course there are racist issues here in this country (esp toward blacks and hispanics these days)  but those who are racist are just ignorant hicks whom deserve no attention.   Just wanted to remind you there is a world out there  and you will meet wonderful people who think you are awesome inside and out. You are valuable and have a bright future. Your family is small-minded  but rise above it and use it as motivation to prove them wrong on all accounts.   Sending you my best wishes and if you ever make it to the states  don’t hesitate to PM me!,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.19368686868686869,101068,

Being a darker shade than the rest of my family- it certainly was something I was made aware of pretty early on. Like its nothing anyone held against me and but there were always a few jokes that never really hurt me? It's always other people who have had a problem with the color of my skin and never myself. I remember i was in grade 1 and this really pale kid called me 'kaala' and it didn't really hurt me but i went home and told my mom because I knew it was something bad. She's was just like ask the kid ' agar mun par roz fair and lovely lagata hei kia'. I was expecting her to tell me there was nothing wrong with my skin or whatever but she just so non-chalantly brushed it off and that made me realize that this really was a non-issue.   It's always catches me off guard when someone mentions the color of my skin because i genuinely forget that i'm somewhat different from the rest. Lol there was this one guy who said something to the effect of 'You're pretty handsome for a dark-skinned guy' which just made me lmao.   I guess the point I am trying to make is that people will always talk shit. It should not make any difference to you. If someone calls you out on the colour of your skin then they are scum.

Pakistan has a real issue with color  and our post-colonial effects of racial/color superiority still prevail.   I was relatively tan particularly during puberty and I was constantly reminded of that by family and friends  to the extent that I had serious issues with confidence at a sensitive age like that. My family wasn't exactly ridiculing for it  but I was reminded that fact anyway. I will tell you this for sure that your look gets better with time  and you start feeling more confident with who you are.  So heres the thing. Let me tell you a couple of things that would represent the bigger picture you should be able to see. One  the world doesn't care for your color at the end of the day. They tell you finding love is hard? Don't pay heed to it  work on yourself. Work on who you are in every other way - education  work  excercise/health and personality. Study hard  go to a good uni in Pakistan or abroad and broaden your horizons. I also cannot stress on how important it is too dress well  nd people don't do that in Pakistan (feel free to shoot a DM if you think you need any help there). But regardless. Your looks don't mean as much as all of this in the end. You could be a Brad Pitt and still not find anything big in life if you don't have the other attributes.   The love of your life  who I really recommend you wait out for  wouldn't care for the color of your skin. She'll love you for how you look  and who you are. I know it sounds cliched but it is very very true  and I can't stress that enough. Wait  don't settle  no matter what your family has to say.  Your family isn't out of the ordinary. They're doing what many families in Pakistan do without realising the psychological toll they're taking on their kids. You're in your A Levels so keep your focus there rn. Feel free to DM me for other stuff  more than willing to help with everything else. I promise you the bigger picture eventually is much much better through  just grow a thicker skin and learn how to shut this out. You'll be just fine.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.1995940170940171,101083,

Firstly  nobody wants to pay taxes when they know that nobody else is paying taxes- simple as that. Most people that arent paying taxes are surrounded by likewise people which account for a fair amount of the business and land owning population. Not only is being taxed frustrating especially in times with such inflation but its more frustrating being the only one. Secondly  theres no incentive to tax when you know your hard earned money is going into the pockets of some bureaucrats pockets. Regardless of your political beliefs  theres no denying immense corruption in the government which only leaves people wondering why they should even pay taxes in the first place if its only gonna help some government official make his 3rd home abroad.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.0509469696969697,101180,

I’m assuming no one that’s lamenting this decision in this thread knows that the situation in Xinjiang is mostly under control. The establishment of the police state in Xinjiang is pretty much being done with like 90% Uighur personnel indicating that the number of regime sympathizers and population acceptance of Communist rule has reached critical mass. They are confident enough to give the Uighurs guns and AFVs in large quantities and there hasn’t been a mass insurrection yet.  [https://palladiummag.com/2018/11/29/a-week-in-xinjiangs-absolute-surveillance-state/](https://palladiummag.com/2018/11/29/a-week-in-xinjiangs-absolute-surveillance-state/)  >	One big difference with Urumqi was that  again  most people were Uyghur. But the  police were Uyghur  too. The people manning the checkpoints and the  “convenience police stations ” and driving the patrol cars were all  Uyghur. It’s worth emphasizing that whatever is happening in Xinjiang is  not just an invasion by a foreign army hell-bent on annoying the  locals. The locals are quite annoyed  indeed  but it’s their fellow  tribesmen doing the grunt work. Or most of it  anyway. I must say that  the Uyghur police we saw were more easy-going than the Han police we saw  in Urumqi. More chill. Less zealous  you could say. At any rate  they  never gave us a hard time  and we got plenty of smiles and easy  treatment. We also got the feeling that most “police” were just hired  weeks ago. There are just too many of them to be properly trained. It’s  just a job  and most of them don’t really appear to like it. But they’ll  go through the motions. That’s very Chinese  too.   >	 >	Walking through  the old town  an old man selling jade stones and other antiquities waved  us to come in. We didn’t get talked to much at all during the trip  (people were obviously wary of raising suspicion)  so we gladly went  into the store. The man then reached into a drawer and took a picture. I  was wondering if he was going to try and pass off a message to a family  member out of the country. But I watch too many movies. Or maybe I read  The New York Times too much. The old man brought a picture of his son  in military uniform. In broken English  he told us how proud he was of  his son  who had made it to the People’s Liberation Army. There was  nobody else in the store  and no cameras  so we assume that was  spontaneous. We congratulated him and left  without buying his jade  stones.   	 >	Soon afterwards   we saw a military recruitment campaign poster  close to the Kashgar  Bazaar  written in Uyghur. We also saw “special police ” basically  police officers who get to carry guns. All of them Uyghurs. China has no  problem arming Uyghurs  or even getting them into the military. They  trust their loyalty  or at the very least they trust the mechanisms they  have in place to ensure their loyalty.  Now as to why there was unrest in the region in the first place is due to Soviet Era intelligence meddling  the Uighurs were a Muslim minority that were suceptible to radicalizing.   I think as a country that has waged a war in its tribal areas that were ravaged by extremist thought we should learn from China how to mitigate collateral damage. I prefer their method of putting people through camps that teach them skills so they can reintegrate into society rather than dropping hellfire missiles on them and then establishing the writ of the state.  China will perhaps never have the soft power clout to position their successful mainstreaming of Xianjiang as a testament to their style of governance so they have to go through diplomatic back channels and get Muslim majority nations on their side  and they seem to be doing so.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.1427885322224945,101266,

A parallel that I feel can be drawn here is the appointment of black supervisors and slave drivers by some white masters over other black slaves.   Also  it has been observed that some Uighur individuals are prone to radicalization but that does not justify sending entire communities of men to what is essentially a brainwashing camp.  China has been rounding people up and sending them to  ""reeducation"" camps for trivial charges like having WhatsApp on your phone  for behaving lazily and for even acting too religious. Tell me  does this sound like a system for suppressing radicalism? To me it sounds like a silent way to perpetrate cultural genocide.  Places of worship have been obliterated  Muslims are being forced to consume pork and alcohol.

Both Pakistan and India lose more men in cross border incidents in one year than China has in the past 40 years combined.   &#x200B;  Human rights is something I support as well  but there's layers to that as well. Uighurs are generally poorer and less educated. There is a language barrier  China is atheist more or less. What of the economic disparity? How would they get solved? Is the right to health  to education  to work not a basic human right?   &#x200B;  Also there is extremism  let's not kid ourselves  it's not a huge problem  or probably even a problem  but it could lead to resistance to change. That's not good. Only the US can dictate the world.

Pressuring through U.N is the most peaceful way we could go about it. Even then it might not work. What else can you do? Definitely no cia involvement. China likes to maintain control the likes of which we've rarely seen post ww2. They see Islam as a threat and they aren't beating around the bushes trying to be politically correct or garner support. The white supremacists  Hindu nationalists and their little schemes are just fantasies in front of what China's actually doing to the muslims. If we allow this to continue  Uyghurs are going to be overwhelmed completely start believing in this bs PRC feeds them. After that every ethno fascist anti muslim organisation will follow suit. it's not a threat to muslims but a threat to Islam. **They don't need to kill them.** They just need to wipe the ideology.

Which major country have they been able to pressure on anything? Rather than humiliating China on an international stage  we are better off approaching them as allies and influencing their policies in a non-hostile way. We are directly connected to Turkestan. We don't need to resort to the same desperate tactics as the West.  But you are wrong about China targeting Muslims. I don't see China targeting the Hui Muslims  who are left to their own devices  since they are culturally Han. They are targeting Uighurs and their culture  who just so happen to be Muslims. China is deeply insecure about their exterior regions and probably for good reason. Tibet and Turkestan are both on the receiving end for more or less the same reasons.  &#x200B;  I am not saying any of this is right. I am just saying we have better and more productive options. The West and India have no interest in Uighur/Tibetan rights. They would prefer to see these regions implode and drag down China into a Syria like situation. Once again  being directly adjacent we would be dealing with the refugees (we all know how welcoming the West and India have been to Afghans  despite championing democracy there)  so be careful what you wish for.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.07303968253968253,101359,

I don't believe that. They have far more control in the east where the entire South China Sea is within range of Chinese missiles on the mainland. If they become ""boxed in the east""  then they have already lost  and Gwadar or fifty other bases won't save them.  They built Gwadar because 80% of their gas and oil comes from the Gulf and through the Indian Ocean. They needed a presence closer to the oil source  and Pakistan provided one.  >The US and China has more value in trade then India and China has. Didn't stop the US from starting a trade war.  There was no trade war through the previous 8 US presidencies while China's economy was growing. Then Trump started one. Trump also started trade wars with the EU  Japan  India  Mexico  Canada. Simultaneously. I don't think you can judge geopolitics by what Trump does. This man has done things that no US president did before.  The other difference is that the US is the world's richest country  it can afford to have trade wars. India is much poorer  and hasn't started any trade wars yet. And China loves trade  they don't start trade wars either. I don't see any comparison between the two situations.  >And no  a Chinese and Indian ally is impossible. India seeks to become the regional hegemony  while China is a prospective ally.  Nobody mentioned ""allies"". All I implied was ""not enemies"". They can come to an understanding where neither country is actively trying to hurt the other  where there aren't hundreds of nuclear missiles on each side  aimed at the other. They will still compete over trade and influence  but in a non-confrontational way.  The reason they might do this is because it costs money to maintain the military buildup. India isn't rich to begin with  and China has other worries in military matters  namely the US and Japan. Both India and China want the tension between them to de-escalate  because tension costs money and impedes trade.  I have no time machine to look into the future  so I don't know any more than you do what will happen. But I think that the geopolitical equations working out across the region right now favor a detente between China and India. Russia is friendly with both countries and is also actively encouraging some kind of peace between the two.",,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.06042857142857142,101384,

Hate to be rain on your parade but almost everyone I know outside Pakistan is also complaining about office politics and stuff whether it is the middle east or UK or France. The most common phrase everyone uses to that is its better to be crying in a Mercedes than to be crying in a Mehran.  Articles is the phase where everyone has a reason to whine and complain. Yes most of the stuff people say is true. Years later I realize most of the late sittings would have been avoided had we had a better job incharge supervisor or manager who actually knew how to work  with people rather than just ordering. Although 2 years into your articles you ll find yourself being the authority figure your juniors complain about  Whether you have qualified or are part qualified matters alot  Post articles is the most crucial phase... I have friends who are still working at 40k per month as a supervisor in a firm (5 years later) and others earning insane amounts.   If you stay in firm / services advisory consultancy company you d have an authority position but still would have to work late hours.  Industry would probably have better hours   Also matters which line if work you are allotted to. Audit is the most glamorous (everyone wants to transfer in) but it is also the one with the most politics. Ironically its the one earning less revenue for audit firms.

Now here’s the kicker before partition the entire subcontinent was considered India. Which is why Iqbal wrote “Sare jahan se acha”. Jinnah was pissed when the 2nd state in the partition chose to call itself India. You can’t be a portion of the entire subcontinent and still refer to yourself after the name that was designated for the entirety of this region. When You fallaciously name yourself In this manner  your citizens start to assume themselves to be patriarchs and owners of the history of the entire landmass. Today So many Indians believe their land was stolen by Pakistan. LOL. They think the history of Indus belongs to them. How could that be? The Indian nation state has succeeded in deluding a good chunk of its population to believe someone else’s history is their history 😂,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.2857142857142857,101396,0.045

For example  Muslim scholars of Mansura (in Sindh) referred to themselves as Sindhi and kept that as their surname way back as a thousand years ago. Famous examples include Abu Raja Sindhi and Mashar Sindhi.  &#x200B;  Going further into pre-Islamic times  it was similar  though more aligned towards tribal affinity. The people also associated themselves with their Kingdoms or City States  with examples such as Taksi (Taxila) or Gandhari (Gandhara).  &#x200B;  Outsiders generally called the people of the Indus Region in a uniform term that was usually linked to the Indus Region. The people of the South Indus Region (modern-day Sindh) were called Sindhus  Sindhavas  and later Hidush  Hindush  Hindus by the Achaemenids. The Greeks referred to the Indus Region as ""Indika"" and it's people as Indikoi.  &#x200B;  The association of the entire subcontinent with the Indus-origin names was spread by Herodotus who referred to all peoples living East of Persia as ""Indikoi"" due to a lack of knowledge of the region. He did not know of Peninsular India (modern-day India) and it was not even present on his map. However by the time knowledge further grew of the region  the term had already stuck.  &#x200B;  Pre-Herodotus scholars generally referred to Indika as the region that now makes up modern-day Sindh.   &#x200B;  Meanwhile the people of modern-day India referred to the ""land of the five rivers"" (Indus Region) as Aratta and Panchanada  the people of this land were called Vahik  Vahika or Bahlika  meaning ""outsider"". They also spoke of the tribes of this land in association with each other.   &#x200B;  Here are some quotes from Hindu texts;     *“Where these five rivers  Shatadru  Vipasha  the third Iravati  Chandrabhaga and Vitasta flow and where there are Pilu-forests and (where) Sindhu is the sixth to flow out  this country is called Aratta…”*   &#x200B;  *“that (region) where these five rivers  emerging from the mountains flow  this Aratta (country) is called Balhika where the Arya should not stay even for two days”.*  &#x200B;  *""The regions are called by the name of Aratta. The people residing there are called the Vahikas. (VIII.30.47) The lowest of brahmanas also are residing there from very remote times. They are without the Veda and without knowledge  without sacrifice and without the power to assist at other's sacrifices. They are all fallen and many amongst them have been begotten by Shudras upon other peoples' girls. The gods never accept any gifts from them. The Prasthalas  the Madras  the Gandharas  the Arattas  those called Khasas  the Vasatis  the Sindhus and the Sauviras are as blamable in their practices.'"" (VIII.30.74) ""*     When it says ""as blamable in their practices"" it means they are of the same culture (Bahlika culture).  \[All the tribes named in that quote were the major tribes of the Indus Region. Prasthalas were located in East Punjab  Madras were based in North Punjab  Gandharas were based primarily around KPK but also extended to Afghanistan and Punjab  the Arattas is the collective name for all these peoples  the Khasas resided in Kashmir  Sindhus inhabited Sindh and South Punjab  Sauviras made up east of Sindh; around Thar and Rajasthan and we do not know much about the Vasatis.\]     *""The Bahlikas are thieves and those from Surashtra (Gujarat) are of mixed breed. Shame on those from Aratta and the land of the rive rivers. They are ungrateful and steal the property of others. They are addicted to drinking liquor and have intercourse with the wives of their preceptors.""*  &#x200B;  *""But on seeing the dharma practiced in the land of the five rivers  the grandfather cried  ""Shame!"". They are outcasts. They are born from servants. They are the performers of wicked deeds. That is the reason the grandfather condemned the dharma in the land of the five rivers. Though they followed their own dharma and that of their varna  he did not honour it.""*     *""Having gone to the Bahlikas  I learnt the following. There  one first becomes a brahmana and then becomes a kshatriya. Thereafter  one becomes a vaishya  a shudra and finally a barber. Having become a barber  one once again becomes a brahmana. Having become a brahmana there  one is once again as a slave. In every family  there is only one virtuous brahmana. Everyone else follows one's desires. The Gandharas  the Madrakas and the Bahlikas possess limited intelligence.""*  &#x200B;  The last verse is interesting as it showed we did not follow the caste system.  &#x200B;  TLDR: The ancestors of Pakistanis referred to themselves by their ethnicity  tribe  or kingdom.",,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.06002976190476191,101399,

AKA BEING RABBITS and lose decency  in front of any girl seen(+20 points to that if any skin can be seen).  Bring back Co-ed Education and most of our societies social interaction skills would be fixed. No boy would do stupid shit unless he wants the girls to hate him and girls would stop being so shy that they will speak up about what they want to do at least(One of the reasons girl don't do anything what they want ). Less horny due to interactions with girls/boys will mean less need to be rabbit like after marriage.  Also need to give a government sponsored sex-ed and family planning ads on the 9 pm news so that all people can hear and see it. The look on the faces of people will be priceless by the way.  The reason it is not given is that the parents themselves did not get it and are completely ignorant of the internet amply put or do know and say internet will teach them better. Girls I think are at least told some  sex-ed(Don't know much though) stuff from mothers I think but males nah let them be hyenas for all they care.  Also forgot that it is something like taboo to talk about this for some reason.  Good question and something fresh for a change also I think.

It would make a bad impression to the incoming party that they are not seen as important to be greeted by the higher ups staff/themselves of the visiting party.  For Families the simple answer is to stop telling the whole world that they need to come to the airport. Sometimes it becomes necessary for more to come as the wider family may have gone together for travel and more people are needed to get them from airport.

If it doesn't effect elite class this much  they should stop making issues out of non-issues then.  This is sanitisation.
