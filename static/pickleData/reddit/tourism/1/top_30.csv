They were light skinned(for what it's worth  which is nothing btw). Our society is all sorts of fucked up. This color complex is basically our inbuilt caste system that we have ingrained in us and can't get rid of. Wear that color with pride  wear it like armor and it can never be used to hurt you.

Dark skin is beautiful  and I honestly didn’t know this was a thing in Pakistan as far as being looked down upon.  I am half Pakistani  born in the states and not really in touch with my Pakistani side unfortunately which is why I follow this sub and once in a while read a post when it pops up on my feed here. After reading your post  I felt so compelled to respond.   Skin color is not something we have any control over. Family is supposed to support you and treat you with respect. Evidently  your family is quite the opposite. In fact  your family’s behavior toward you is emotionally abusive!  Work hard on your studies  travel in the future  you will meet so many people who don’t even see skin color. Living here in the states  for example  my group of friends come from all backgrounds  and the color of skin is not even registered. Of course there are racist issues here in this country (esp toward blacks and hispanics these days)  but those who are racist are just ignorant hicks whom deserve no attention.   Just wanted to remind you there is a world out there  and you will meet wonderful people who think you are awesome inside and out. You are valuable and have a bright future. Your family is small-minded  but rise above it and use it as motivation to prove them wrong on all accounts.   Sending you my best wishes and if you ever make it to the states  don’t hesitate to PM me!,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.193686869,101068,

My skin colour is way darker compared to my family - my siblings always called me 'Kali ma' in reference to the Hindu goddess. Whenever I visit my relatives in Pakistan they recommend me fair and lovely  no kidding. In contrast to this many times Gore told me that they really like my skin color. This just taught me that beauty is really in the eye of the beholder. Learn to love yourself and don't give a shit what these people  even your family thinks about you.

I don’t have much advice but I just thought maybe you’d feel better knowing there’s A LOT of us out there. And yes  our media and our society place light skin on a pedestal. There are almost no actual dark skinned women in the media  and many that started out as tan or dark eventually end up lightening somehow. The crazy think is in my community of Pakistanis as I look around MOST of the people are tan-brown skinned so idk what demographic looks like the people on tv.

Being a darker shade than the rest of my family- it certainly was something I was made aware of pretty early on. Like its nothing anyone held against me and but there were always a few jokes that never really hurt me? It's always other people who have had a problem with the color of my skin and never myself. I remember i was in grade 1 and this really pale kid called me 'kaala' and it didn't really hurt me but i went home and told my mom because I knew it was something bad. She's was just like ask the kid ' agar mun par roz fair and lovely lagata hei kia'. I was expecting her to tell me there was nothing wrong with my skin or whatever but she just so non-chalantly brushed it off and that made me realize that this really was a non-issue.   It's always catches me off guard when someone mentions the color of my skin because i genuinely forget that i'm somewhat different from the rest. Lol there was this one guy who said something to the effect of 'You're pretty handsome for a dark-skinned guy' which just made me lmao.   I guess the point I am trying to make is that people will always talk shit. It should not make any difference to you. If someone calls you out on the colour of your skin then they are scum.

Pakistan has a real issue with color  and our post-colonial effects of racial/color superiority still prevail.   I was relatively tan particularly during puberty and I was constantly reminded of that by family and friends  to the extent that I had serious issues with confidence at a sensitive age like that. My family wasn't exactly ridiculing for it  but I was reminded that fact anyway. I will tell you this for sure that your look gets better with time  and you start feeling more confident with who you are.  So heres the thing. Let me tell you a couple of things that would represent the bigger picture you should be able to see. One  the world doesn't care for your color at the end of the day. They tell you finding love is hard? Don't pay heed to it  work on yourself. Work on who you are in every other way - education  work  excercise/health and personality. Study hard  go to a good uni in Pakistan or abroad and broaden your horizons. I also cannot stress on how important it is too dress well  nd people don't do that in Pakistan (feel free to shoot a DM if you think you need any help there). But regardless. Your looks don't mean as much as all of this in the end. You could be a Brad Pitt and still not find anything big in life if you don't have the other attributes.   The love of your life  who I really recommend you wait out for  wouldn't care for the color of your skin. She'll love you for how you look  and who you are. I know it sounds cliched but it is very very true  and I can't stress that enough. Wait  don't settle  no matter what your family has to say.  Your family isn't out of the ordinary. They're doing what many families in Pakistan do without realising the psychological toll they're taking on their kids. You're in your A Levels so keep your focus there rn. Feel free to DM me for other stuff  more than willing to help with everything else. I promise you the bigger picture eventually is much much better through  just grow a thicker skin and learn how to shut this out. You'll be just fine.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.199594017,101083,

NUST might give you better job placements locally  but that's arguable too. If you end up paying the same for both  it's gonna be a stupid decision to go to NUST. If money is not a factor then go to LUMS. Yes  you can get a minor  but you'll have to manage all your courses yourself.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.1535,101001,

You need to take 12 credit hours out of SSE  and besides that you can take whichever course you want to take. After first year you are allowed to take Max 20 credit hours  which can be 5 or 6 courses. And if you want even more  you can discuss it with your advisor. If you're interested in research and further studies LUMS is a great place that can give you a taste of that in your undergrad. Many of my batch mates are in top universities of US.

It's not that big of a deal. There's the library and computer lab to study all night. That structure is for one major only. You have to take 130cr. Not all of them go towards your major  some are extras like in groups and out groups and free electives. And across majors the basic/pre req course are the same within the school. For a minor you have to take 7 courses from that discipline  you can manage them within your in groups  out groups and free electives. You pay for 130  you want to go above you pay more. It's not that difficult  you can sit with a professor and plan it out once you're done with the pre reqs or the 1st year.  You'll figure it out don't worry  relax and enjoy your time at LUMS.

The laboratories are one of the largest science and technology institutions in Pakistan  and conduct multidisciplinary research and development in fields such as national security  space exploration  and supercomputing.While the laboratories remain highly classified  the KRL is most famous for its research  development  and production of Highly-Enriched Uranium (HEU)  using gas centrifuge (Zippe-type) technological methods roughly based on the model of the Urenco Group—the technology brought by Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan  who worked there as a senior scientist.  Since its inception  there has been a large number of employed technical staff members with majority being physicists and mathematicians  assisted by engineers (both army and civilians)  chemists  and material scientists.  ***  ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/pakistan/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.123068783,99974,

Firstly  nobody wants to pay taxes when they know that nobody else is paying taxes- simple as that. Most people that arent paying taxes are surrounded by likewise people which account for a fair amount of the business and land owning population. Not only is being taxed frustrating especially in times with such inflation but its more frustrating being the only one. Secondly  theres no incentive to tax when you know your hard earned money is going into the pockets of some bureaucrats pockets.

I finally booked for $800 and a slightly less convenient itinerary instead.  It was just confusing because Kayak had identified a United/Lufthansa flight that couldn't be found for that price at either airline's sites.    Then I looked into some past complaints about justfly.com  who books on behalf of Kayak  and I see that others have had problems with them before with them coming back a day or two later and saying that they couldn't book your flight.

You can book with one or the other  but they have difficulty guaranteeing that you can pay for your luggage for both legs together.

Usually what happens is that they book you into the same class/whatever is available but sometimes the same class can have different benefits on different airlines. I do wish they would book like-for-like benefits but that will probably result in codeshare flights being extremely expensive. The world of codeshares is very confusing (case in point I recently booked a flight from YVR to LAX with Air Canada selling the flight for $600+ while United sold the same flights for $250 - the flight was operated by Air Canada but you can probably guess which airlines I booked with).,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",-0.078636364,102848,
kljshfdi,Best U.S. third-party website to book a flight?,"**Resolved:  I ended up booking a different flight for about $80 more and a less convenient itinerary.  But I'll leave this post up in case it's relevant to anything else.  Thanks for everyones help!**  Sorry  I didn't see this answered in the FAQ.  I'm interested in flying from Chicago to Europe.  Every search engine online shows a $650 flight on United  but United's own website charges $1250 for the same flight.  It doesn't seem to be just a case of stale information on the other search engines.  This flight is also for 3 months in advance. So I'm thinking I might need to buy from Orbitz  Expedia  Kayak  or one of the third-parties.  Which one is best or has the best service or least problems?

If Pakistan decides they won't pay the fine there are a lot of international investors who are willing to invest in Pakistan will either find other countries or will demand a high rate of return.  If Pakistan does not pay up or fix an arrangement to pay in instalments it will be difficult for Pakistan to take loans from foreign banks as it is also possible that Pakistan may deny returning that loan.   One may argue that Pakistan has gold and possible oil reserves but what are you going to do with those reserves when only a few countries do business with you?  You will sell those reserves cheaply to these countries who earn huge profits. Venezuela has the highest proven oil reserves even after that they are not able to do anything.

Acceptable_Topic,Renting cars with Avis and not getting a full fuel tank.,I'm not a very frequent user of rental cars  but I do rent 3-4 cars a year.

I can see why an attendant might say that as an explanation (because it’s true  whether or not it’s your fault as could be construed from the wording) because she’s been dealing with irate customers and that’s what happened and people can’t really argue with that.  I don’t think she necessarily meant to single you out as being to blame for the delay  just that this is what happened  and now we’re moving. She might well not have even considered your reaction to that or if she did  not understood it might be a negative reaction.  Of course  as a professional she should know better  but I don’t think you can assume it’s malicious.

I have already read numerous posts about Barcelona on this board  but was just hoping to get a bit more insight than what I could find by searching.  **Some Details**:   I'm staying in Eixample  right by Casa Mila  and I'll be in the city from Tuesday-Thursday (traveling to/from on Monday and Friday). I'm excited to see the architecture and wander the streets  and maybe go to a museum or two if they're really worthwhile. When I travel  I like to really invest in experiences  and am open to tours and different activities.  I plan to go to Casa Batllo  La Sagrada Familia  Parque Guell  and would like to walk around the Gothic Quarter  Las Ramblas/La Boqueria.  I am currently *not* planning to spend time at the beach  as I'll be spending a week on the islands of Greece right beforehand.   **Questions/Suggestions Needed:**  * I've seen some information about the Barcelona Pass  Barcelona City Pass  and Barcelona Card  but I'm not really sure which one would be the best fit. Any recommendations or comparisons here would be helpful. * For Parque Guell and Sagrada Familia - I know I have to buy tickets in advance. Does it make sense to visit these two places on the same day? I'm currently thinking of going to Sagrada Familia early in the morning so it won't be too crowded. If I go to see both on the same day I'm wondering what time you might recommend I get tickets for each. * I was thinking about maybe doing a wine/cava tour of some sort  if anyone has done something like that in Barcelona before  did you enjoy it and do you have any suggestions? * I heard that for Cathedrals like Sagrada Familia  knees and shoulders must be covered. Is this strictly enforced? I want to be respectful and will certainly follow this if I need to  but I also don't love the idea of needing to wear long pants in the middle of August. * Are there are specific restaurants / tapas bars that you loved in Barcelona?

Definitely buy tickets in advance for Park Guell and Sagrada Família. My recommendation would be to do Park Guell in the morning before the crowds set in.   Sagrada Família has tighter restrictions on how many people can be let in and your ticket is for a more specific time  so it’s not too crowded no matter what time you go at. One thing to think of is that the inside of the Sagrada Família was designed with stained glass windows that color the morning light cool and the evening light warm  so if you have a preference  I would consider that. We went around 4 and I loved it because it was about equally warm and cool lighting at first and got progressively warmer as the sun moved.   From what I saw  Sagrada Família didn’t really enforce the dress rules too harshly. When they say shoulders and legs  shorts/dress/skirt down to around your knees would be enough as would a short sleeved tee. But when I was there people were in tank tops so idk.   Our favorite tapas place was called Tapas 24! It was delicious. Definitely worth checking out.   While you’re walking down Las Ramblas  make sure to check out St Joseph’s market for delicious food! This was one of the highlights of my trip.   Some more things to see and do: check out Hospital de Sant Pau and the magic fountain show at night!   Hope you have a great time!,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.366255144,102456,0.512

I would do Park Guell in the morning and sagrada familia in the afternoon. As others have said Park Guell was underwhelming and not worth it (in my opinion) but do what you want. I wore a short sleeve shirt and skirt that went a little lower than mid-thigh and was good for sagrada familia. As long as your not in short shorts and a string tank top  I think you'll be alright.  Most people speak spanish as well as catalan (and many speak english as well) but i would definitely recommend trying your spanish before reverting to english  they really appreciate it!  Bar Lobo near las ramblas is awesome! Go there! Great drinks and food.  Montjuic was mentioned previously and I recommend that as well. They have a set of cable cars that has a pretty ride and will take you to around to the top.  Another thing we thought was cool was the L'Aquarium. It was nice to escape the heat and see the marine life (they have a really awesome shark tunnel). It didn't take too long to go through (1-2 hrs max) and me and my boyfriend had a great time.  Also the beach kinda sucked (hard gravel-like sand/rocks and super crowded) so if you're going to the islands after I would say skipping it is the right decision.  Happy Travels!,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.267912946,102461,

I’ve heard Casa Mila sunset on the roof is spectacular but I didn’t personally go  - Las Ramblas sucks. super touristy in the nasty way that many European cities can be at their worst. although we did find some great restaurants nearby  I wouldn’t spend any other time there  - parts of the beach area suck too  if you insist on the beach go as far north up in the city as possible to avoid tourist traps and huge crowds (ie. Platja de Bogatell)  - Vinitus for the trendiest/best tapas in the city. will be close to where you’re staying in Eixample. apparently Cervesería Catalana is also great  - La Sagrada Familia is unbelievably packed but worth it  make sure you get tickets ASAP. try to get tickets that include a trip up one of the towers  that was my favorite part,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.193402778,102462,

The biggest reason is that Angus beef is not available in Pakistan and our cow breeds are sub par.  Then on top of that we make that sub par breed taste even worse because our cows are grass fed which results in a very gamey taste  same as wild cows in the West.     American Angus beef has a very mild taste and eating it raw is still as gamey as eating a rare grass fed steak and If you cook it rare is like butter already straight from Walmart into a pan.   So to make that gamey taste either you can properly marinate the shit out of the steak or overcook it as most people can't even marinate it well.  Eid is coming  try making your own steak and see if you can make that strong taste go away  its almost acidic.   Our animals are not raised and given the proper food to be enjoyed rare.   The very top restaurants in Pakistan are importing Angus and even American fast food chains are importing their patties for this sole reason.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.162102564,100511,
