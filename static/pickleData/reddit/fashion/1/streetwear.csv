I found a store that has very nice wool trousers on sale but the only stores that have them are nowhere near my location  so I can't get actual sizing. I generally wear 34/34 or 34/32 but I'm always unsure about how pants should fit: should they be touching the shoes? Go longer so I can cuff them? I don't want to get too short  either  as has sometimes happened with pants and they don't reach my shoes and there's a little gap  between my pants and shoes (but not in a deliberate  cool way that some people seem to be able to pull off). If anyone can help guide me and ease my many neuroses I'd appreciate it.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.1945,13847,0.238

It gives me more casual vibes but it’s obvious there was effort. Something about the shirt doesn’t look right to me... not sure what. I like that you rolled the sleeves but maybe if the shirt had been white instead of blue (so it matched the shoes). It also might help to wear a pair of stud earrings. Just simple ones  like pearl or diamond (obvi good quality fakes are my go to lol). Where did you get the pants tho?/what brand are they?

So many people have given me great information- and I’ll be taking it all in and working with all of it. So  thank you to everyone who has offered great advice and kind words! I am very new at this!  I’ve had a lot of comments about “wealth” and other things- everything in this photo was thrifted or bought super cheap  and I want to bring an element of affordable street wear to the table as well.   I’ve also had a lot of comments on my looks- which isn’t what this post is about. I barely wore makeup and went for a more masc look because how I look facially isn’t what I wanted this focus to be. Please focus on offering actual criticism on my clothing and how I can make it more street or better instead. :)   I’ll try to reply to everyone. Thank you again!,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.33594877344877344,14634,

The pants cut a nice silhouette. I feel like there’s some room for improvement. If the shirt was hemmed up  tailored  and untucked  there wouldn’t be the odd interplay with the pants.   You really dropped the ball with the sock choice.  Definitely could have added a pop of complimentary color that would be acceptable at work and make the transition to street much smoother.

Probably not on everyone  but on you  it's working. Great contrast and color. Part of it is your hairstyle though. Again  good on you  maybe not on everyone.  I still feel like it's missing something. Some bold pop from an accessory or something.. chunky bracelet  maybe a brooch or even a vintage cameo if you wanted to stick with a throwback vibe.  The only other thing I'd nitpick are the kicks. They're great  but a low key pair of low rise canvas sneakers or women's casual flats would take this look from slightly androgynous to full-on feminine with just that subtle change. And if a more andro look is what you're going for  ignore this comment with impunity. You've got style.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.1738888888888889,14752,

It doesn’t have to be different pants  tbh. For example  a vertical striped short sleeve would look incredible with this imo. Keep in mind though that this is only one person’s opinion  so take it with a grain of salt. If you like the way you look  nothing else really matters!   However  if you want to experiment with different materials  silk and leather textures can go a long way  especially for this style. Some looser pants would also look incredible with this kind of outfit. Again  these are just some of my recommendations!,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.2681818181818182,14762,

1172,chddaniel,[DISCUSSION] Ultimate Air Jordan 1 QC/L.C. Checklist - With Fake Vs Real Comparisons,Hello fellow JORDANheadz  I'm hoping you'll be able to help me make this resource even better  should you know your stuff.  Please remember  **this guide is meant to be an all around for most Jordan 1 releases**  so whatever you recommend has to apply to most colourways (exception: stuff like Satin SBB or other special releases). Anything you see that can be improved  lmk in the comments.  Also worth noting: we analyze the best fakes first  then dive into alternative batches. If it looks like we haven't analysed the best replica  there's a reason why we explained some other flaw on another version of the fake.  I need to drop this link here so that Google won't penalize the LegitCheck App's blog  thinking it's a duplicate. I recommend having a look there as well since there are 11 tells but below I'll list the topmost 5: [https://chdaniel.com/legitcheckapp/guides/air-jordan/fake-vs-real-universal-guide/](https://chdaniel.com/legitcheckapp/guides/air-jordan/fake-vs-real-universal-guide/)  Also  check the footer of this post where I put together all the previous Reddit posts (though you can find them all in the app as well)  Without any further ado...  # 1. Air Jordan logo fake vs real  As you will see in the pictures below  fake manufacturers manage to replicate 90 to 98% of the logo right  but there are some shortcomings. [Comparison 1.](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/air-jordan-1-logo-real-vs-fake-1024x1024.jpg)  Broadly speaking we can point out two major things:  1. The authentic Jordan wings logo comes with thinner letters (except for the TM character) 2. At the same time  the overall quality of the print is lower on the fake.  We don’t want to leave it at this broad statement  so we’ll explain these two major flaws with the highlighted areas (highlighted with the hand emoji) and then we’re going to show some other comparisons.  Let’s start with the real vs fake Jordan logo comparison explanation from the left. The “A” character **is significantly thinner** on the authentic pair  but please **notice how the fake “A” outlines are also fuzzier.**  Up next  we want to point out how the “J” and “O” are not completely separate on the fake Air Jordan 1  whereas on the authentic AJ1 example there is definitely spacing between the two.  Ths same flaw can be noticed between “D” and “A” on the fake Air Jordan 1. If you’re wondering how to legitcheck Air Jordan 1’s  this is one of the fastest ways — look out for inconsistencies on the size tag  such as this one.  Coming up next  we’ve highlighted the “R” letter for the lack of precision on the fake example — once again  this is a compromise made by the fake manufacturers so that they can save money. This kind of flaw should never ever happen on an authentic pair.  And here’s one of the most important things on how to spot the fake Nike Air Jordan 1:  >*Pay attention to the spacing between these “wings” elements on the fake logo. Notice how there’s less space between elements on the authentic pair. On top of that  the fake elements are less defined (coming with fuzzier lines).*  Last but not least  it seems like the ™ character is too small on the replica Jordans and  as a consequence  thinner.  I wouldn’t base my authentication solely on the TM logo — rather  I’d be looking for some traits of lower quality manufacturing techniques (such as the other ones we’ve pointed out).  [Comparison 2.](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/air-jordan-1-logo-how-to-spot-fake-2-copy-1024x1024.jpg)  Over here we can notice that the fake letters are not bold  like in the previous comparison — but they’re also not getting the right amount of weight.  It seems like the fake Jordan logo here has very thin letters — so thin that in some cases they’re not completely legible. Notice the fake A’s horizontal line. Or the highlighted line in the “D” letter that’s thin and inconsistent.  At the same time  the “J” character seems to be different — it’s not only the letter’s shape  but also the sizing. For some reason  the fake “J” is taller than the other letters.  Moving on to the ™ character  the fake example in this case is too thick  quite the contrast from the previously analysed replica. The cause of this flaw is visible to the naked eye: it’s bigger than it’s supposed to be.  However  the most glaring flaw here is that the “wings” elements are too close to each other. So close that they’re touching and sometimes even overlapping.  >*If there’s one thing you need to keep in mind when it comes to telling real vs fake Air Jordan 1 logos  it’s this: the original shoe must have a high level of precision and detail.*  That is **the only thing** you need to spot: whether there are any small details that are not precise enough  which would be there as a consequence of compromises in quality.  I’m not saying Nike is never putting out imperfections  it’s just that they’re never letting pairs with *so many* imperfections leave the assembly line.  [Comparison 3](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/air-jordan-1-logo-legit-check-guide-1024x1024.jpg)  This used to be a very common flaw in the past but it’s been majorly fixed. However  most of the time  fake manufacturers fix a flaw and create 2 other flaws.  I was not surprised to see this inconsistency come back as soon as some other big ones were fixed on top-quality replicas.  The R and D in “JORDAN” should always be connected. It’s ironic how top-level fakes have this flaw again  in some cases.  That aside  our go-to thing still applies in this real vs fake comparison above: the wings elements are printed in a poorer manner — fuzzy lines and overlapping areas can be noticed.  # 2. Tongue tag  Up next  we’ll analyse what we usually look after when starting a guide: an element that’s small (therefore needs high-precision manufacturing tools) and hardly visible to anyone but the wearer.  The reason for our thinking is simple: these elements are where the replica manufacturers will compromise. The tongue tag is no exception and in fact I’m surprised myself that we didn’t start the guide with this flaw.  The Air Jordan logo is not perfected even though it’s visible on the outside of the sneaker. But I digress. Let’s have a look at how to spot the fake Jordan 1 this way:  [Comparison tongue tag](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/tongue-tag-air-jordan-1-real-vs-fake-1024x1024.jpg)  There are quite a few things we can look out for but the broad statement is that you need to be aware of two things:  1. A thinner font is used on the fake Air Jordan 1 tag 2. As a consequence  the font is sometimes illegible  The highlighted points show some quick giveaways for the thinner font  but the most important one is the “CHINA” text comparison.  As you can see  the “A” is not entirely legible in the fake example  while the H letter is wider. Naturally  it’s not easy for you to remember these things  so we recommend either coming back to this legitcheck’s guide pictures or keeping an eye out for weakly-printed text.  What do I mean by weakly printed text? Look at the highlighted french “VOTRE” on the Jordan 1 tag. Can you notice how the “E” is not entirely printed?  Maybe a better example is the “E” in “GARANTIE”  the neighbour word. If we compare that to the authentic example  yes  they’re not printed with the utmost precision — but we can see the difference in quality.  Worth mentioning as well is that this is a high-quality replica  thus wavy text does not occur as often as we’ll see soon — but even so  you can notice how the “SWOOSH ®” text is not straight on the fake Jordan tag.  # 3. Nike Swoosh  Enough with the micro-analyses  at least for the moment. Let’s head back to the visible parts of the sneaker.  We’ll have a look at the real vs fake Nike swoosh comparison for the Air Jordan 1.  [Comparison](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/swoosh-air-jordan-1-legit-check-guide-1024x1024.jpg)  It seems like the fake Jordans sometimes come with a bulky end of the Nike swoosh  when it’s supposed to be pointy.  There’s not much to say here besides the fact that it’s an instant callout for a fake pair  should you spot anything like this. Even on top tier replicas (won't name them as my plan is not to promote them) this flaw is present every now and then.  As you might've noticed with fakes  whenever there's a new batch that fixes a flaw  another very-obvious-and-rookie flaw is popping up. Seems like this flaw would be one of those.  # 4. Bulkiness of the shoe  Something replica creators seem to not get right is the overall shape of the sneaker  making it too bulky. Let’s have a look at this real vs fake Jordan 1 shape comparison below:  [Comparison](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/shape-air-jordan-1-fake-vs-real-guide-1024x1024.jpg)  The authentic example’s curvature (highlighted on the upper right side) is not something that you will find on every single original pair  so don’t take that as the go-to way every time.  However  most pairs have that kind of curvature  since they’re made using Nike’s higher-quality moulds.  But let’s leave that aside for a second. The bulkiness of the toe box is a more reliable factor. This is a flaw that is easy to spot when you have both the real and the fake pair next to each other — which 99.999% percent won’t have.  What you can remember though is the fact that  from the profile view  the toe box doesn’t have to come with a straight ascending line.  On the authentic pair  it seems like the toe box curves a tiny bit. As a consequence  highlighted in the lower left corner  the sneaker’s sole sits higher.  When we’re authenticating these sneakers  what we keep in mind is that the sole mustn’t be fantastically flat — and that’s all you need to know when it comes to auth.  checking the sole of the Air Jordan 1.  We’ve attached a second comparison of the AJ1 bulkier construction on the fakes so we can highlight the difference one more time:  [Comparison](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/shape-air-jordan-1-real-vs-fake-1024x1024.jpg)  # 5. Hourglass shape  Speaking of the shoe’s construction  we need to have a look from the rear for this following flaw on the fakes. This is a flaw that indeed is almost fixed on top-tier fakes  but most replicas are not those. Therefore  that  combined with how much time it would save if one knows this makes this flaw worthy of being higher in our top of flaws to look after.  It’s been commonly nicknamed as the “hourglass shape” tell and it’s easier for us to explain it visually with a comparison.  [Comparison](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/hourglass-shape-air-jordan-1-legit-check-guide-1024x1024.jpg)  And now the comparison with [drawn lines on top of the pics to make you understand better](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/hourglass-shape-air-jordan-1-real-vs-fake-1024x1024.jpg).  As you can see  the fake Air Jordan 1 is almost straight when it comes to this angle’s view. On the other hand  the original AJ1 is curving in two places: above and below the medial line.  Below the medial line  keep in mind that the sneaker has to have almost a bell-shaped bottom in order for it to be authentic.  Please note that this flaw is hard to spot when wearing the Jordans but it must be a dead giveaway for a fake.  Top-tier replicas sometimes get this thing right so it’s not the most reliable tell. Nonetheless  it might save you minutes when authenticating since the large majority of fakes are not from the top-tier category.  In other words  knowing this flaw will enable you to spot most of the fakes in a few seconds.  Let us finish this way of spotting fake Nike Air Jordan 1 [by dropping a second example  just to make everything clear.](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/hourglass-shape-air-jordan-1-fake-vs-real-1024x1024.jpg)  # Conclusion  Coming up next is a definitive complete L.C. guide for the...

1173,jzglt,[INSPO] Copped some new slides  thoughts?,Hello fellow JORDANheadz  I'm hoping you'll be able to help me make this resource even better  should you know your stuff.  Please remember  **this guide is meant to be an all around for most Jordan 1 releases**  so whatever you recommend has to apply to most colourways (exception: stuff like Satin SBB or other special releases). Anything you see that can be improved  lmk in the comments.  Also worth noting: we analyze the best fakes first  then dive into alternative batches. If it looks like we haven't analysed the best replica  there's a reason why we explained some other flaw on another version of the fake.  I need to drop this link here so that Google won't penalize the LegitCheck App's blog  thinking it's a duplicate. I recommend having a look there as well since there are 11 tells but below I'll list the topmost 5: [https://chdaniel.com/legitcheckapp/guides/air-jordan/fake-vs-real-universal-guide/](https://chdaniel.com/legitcheckapp/guides/air-jordan/fake-vs-real-universal-guide/)  Also  check the footer of this post where I put together all the previous Reddit posts (though you can find them all in the app as well)  Without any further ado...  # 1. Air Jordan logo fake vs real  As you will see in the pictures below  fake manufacturers manage to replicate 90 to 98% of the logo right  but there are some shortcomings. [Comparison 1.](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/air-jordan-1-logo-real-vs-fake-1024x1024.jpg)  Broadly speaking we can point out two major things:  1. The authentic Jordan wings logo comes with thinner letters (except for the TM character) 2. At the same time  the overall quality of the print is lower on the fake.  We don’t want to leave it at this broad statement  so we’ll explain these two major flaws with the highlighted areas (highlighted with the hand emoji) and then we’re going to show some other comparisons.  Let’s start with the real vs fake Jordan logo comparison explanation from the left. The “A” character **is significantly thinner** on the authentic pair  but please **notice how the fake “A” outlines are also fuzzier.**  Up next  we want to point out how the “J” and “O” are not completely separate on the fake Air Jordan 1  whereas on the authentic AJ1 example there is definitely spacing between the two.  Ths same flaw can be noticed between “D” and “A” on the fake Air Jordan 1. If you’re wondering how to legitcheck Air Jordan 1’s  this is one of the fastest ways — look out for inconsistencies on the size tag  such as this one.  Coming up next  we’ve highlighted the “R” letter for the lack of precision on the fake example — once again  this is a compromise made by the fake manufacturers so that they can save money. This kind of flaw should never ever happen on an authentic pair.  And here’s one of the most important things on how to spot the fake Nike Air Jordan 1:  >*Pay attention to the spacing between these “wings” elements on the fake logo. Notice how there’s less space between elements on the authentic pair. On top of that  the fake elements are less defined (coming with fuzzier lines).*  Last but not least  it seems like the ™ character is too small on the replica Jordans and  as a consequence  thinner.  I wouldn’t base my authentication solely on the TM logo — rather  I’d be looking for some traits of lower quality manufacturing techniques (such as the other ones we’ve pointed out).  [Comparison 2.](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/air-jordan-1-logo-how-to-spot-fake-2-copy-1024x1024.jpg)  Over here we can notice that the fake letters are not bold  like in the previous comparison — but they’re also not getting the right amount of weight.  It seems like the fake Jordan logo here has very thin letters — so thin that in some cases they’re not completely legible. Notice the fake A’s horizontal line. Or the highlighted line in the “D” letter that’s thin and inconsistent.  At the same time  the “J” character seems to be different — it’s not only the letter’s shape  but also the sizing. For some reason  the fake “J” is taller than the other letters.  Moving on to the ™ character  the fake example in this case is too thick  quite the contrast from the previously analysed replica. The cause of this flaw is visible to the naked eye: it’s bigger than it’s supposed to be.  However  the most glaring flaw here is that the “wings” elements are too close to each other. So close that they’re touching and sometimes even overlapping.  >*If there’s one thing you need to keep in mind when it comes to telling real vs fake Air Jordan 1 logos  it’s this: the original shoe must have a high level of precision and detail.*  That is **the only thing** you need to spot: whether there are any small details that are not precise enough  which would be there as a consequence of compromises in quality.  I’m not saying Nike is never putting out imperfections  it’s just that they’re never letting pairs with *so many* imperfections leave the assembly line.  [Comparison 3](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/air-jordan-1-logo-legit-check-guide-1024x1024.jpg)  This used to be a very common flaw in the past but it’s been majorly fixed. However  most of the time  fake manufacturers fix a flaw and create 2 other flaws.  I was not surprised to see this inconsistency come back as soon as some other big ones were fixed on top-quality replicas.  The R and D in “JORDAN” should always be connected. It’s ironic how top-level fakes have this flaw again  in some cases.  That aside  our go-to thing still applies in this real vs fake comparison above: the wings elements are printed in a poorer manner — fuzzy lines and overlapping areas can be noticed.  # 2. Tongue tag  Up next  we’ll analyse what we usually look after when starting a guide: an element that’s small (therefore needs high-precision manufacturing tools) and hardly visible to anyone but the wearer.  The reason for our thinking is simple: these elements are where the replica manufacturers will compromise. The tongue tag is no exception and in fact I’m surprised myself that we didn’t start the guide with this flaw.  The Air Jordan logo is not perfected even though it’s visible on the outside of the sneaker. But I digress. Let’s have a look at how to spot the fake Jordan 1 this way:  [Comparison tongue tag](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/tongue-tag-air-jordan-1-real-vs-fake-1024x1024.jpg)  There are quite a few things we can look out for but the broad statement is that you need to be aware of two things:  1. A thinner font is used on the fake Air Jordan 1 tag 2. As a consequence  the font is sometimes illegible  The highlighted points show some quick giveaways for the thinner font  but the most important one is the “CHINA” text comparison.  As you can see  the “A” is not entirely legible in the fake example  while the H letter is wider. Naturally  it’s not easy for you to remember these things  so we recommend either coming back to this legitcheck’s guide pictures or keeping an eye out for weakly-printed text.  What do I mean by weakly printed text? Look at the highlighted french “VOTRE” on the Jordan 1 tag. Can you notice how the “E” is not entirely printed?  Maybe a better example is the “E” in “GARANTIE”  the neighbour word. If we compare that to the authentic example  yes  they’re not printed with the utmost precision — but we can see the difference in quality.  Worth mentioning as well is that this is a high-quality replica  thus wavy text does not occur as often as we’ll see soon — but even so  you can notice how the “SWOOSH ®” text is not straight on the fake Jordan tag.  # 3. Nike Swoosh  Enough with the micro-analyses  at least for the moment. Let’s head back to the visible parts of the sneaker.  We’ll have a look at the real vs fake Nike swoosh comparison for the Air Jordan 1.  [Comparison](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/swoosh-air-jordan-1-legit-check-guide-1024x1024.jpg)  It seems like the fake Jordans sometimes come with a bulky end of the Nike swoosh  when it’s supposed to be pointy.  There’s not much to say here besides the fact that it’s an instant callout for a fake pair  should you spot anything like this. Even on top tier replicas (won't name them as my plan is not to promote them) this flaw is present every now and then.  As you might've noticed with fakes  whenever there's a new batch that fixes a flaw  another very-obvious-and-rookie flaw is popping up. Seems like this flaw would be one of those.  # 4. Bulkiness of the shoe  Something replica creators seem to not get right is the overall shape of the sneaker  making it too bulky. Let’s have a look at this real vs fake Jordan 1 shape comparison below:  [Comparison](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/shape-air-jordan-1-fake-vs-real-guide-1024x1024.jpg)  The authentic example’s curvature (highlighted on the upper right side) is not something that you will find on every single original pair  so don’t take that as the go-to way every time.

Please remember  **this guide is meant to be an all around for most Jordan 1 releases**  so whatever you recommend has to apply to most colourways (exception: stuff like Satin SBB or other special releases). Anything you see that can be improved  lmk in the comments.  Also worth noting: we analyze the best fakes first  then dive into alternative batches. If it looks like we haven't analysed the best replica  there's a reason why we explained some other flaw on another version of the fake.  I need to drop this link here so that Google won't penalize the LegitCheck App's blog  thinking it's a duplicate. I recommend having a look there as well since there are 11 tells but below I'll list the topmost 5: [https://chdaniel.com/legitcheckapp/guides/air-jordan/fake-vs-real-universal-guide/](https://chdaniel.com/legitcheckapp/guides/air-jordan/fake-vs-real-universal-guide/)  Also  check the footer of this post where I put together all the previous Reddit posts (though you can find them all in the app as well)  Without any further ado...  # 1. Air Jordan logo fake vs real  As you will see in the pictures below  fake manufacturers manage to replicate 90 to 98% of the logo right  but there are some shortcomings. [Comparison 1.](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/air-jordan-1-logo-real-vs-fake-1024x1024.jpg)  Broadly speaking we can point out two major things:  1. The authentic Jordan wings logo comes with thinner letters (except for the TM character) 2. At the same time  the overall quality of the print is lower on the fake.  We don’t want to leave it at this broad statement  so we’ll explain these two major flaws with the highlighted areas (highlighted with the hand emoji) and then we’re going to show some other comparisons.  Let’s start with the real vs fake Jordan logo comparison explanation from the left. The “A” character **is significantly thinner** on the authentic pair  but please **notice how the fake “A” outlines are also fuzzier.**  Up next  we want to point out how the “J” and “O” are not completely separate on the fake Air Jordan 1  whereas on the authentic AJ1 example there is definitely spacing between the two.  Ths same flaw can be noticed between “D” and “A” on the fake Air Jordan 1. If you’re wondering how to legitcheck Air Jordan 1’s  this is one of the fastest ways — look out for inconsistencies on the size tag  such as this one.  Coming up next  we’ve highlighted the “R” letter for the lack of precision on the fake example — once again  this is a compromise made by the fake manufacturers so that they can save money. This kind of flaw should never ever happen on an authentic pair.  And here’s one of the most important things on how to spot the fake Nike Air Jordan 1:  >*Pay attention to the spacing between these “wings” elements on the fake logo. Notice how there’s less space between elements on the authentic pair. On top of that  the fake elements are less defined (coming with fuzzier lines).*  Last but not least  it seems like the ™ character is too small on the replica Jordans and  as a consequence  thinner.  I wouldn’t base my authentication solely on the TM logo — rather  I’d be looking for some traits of lower quality manufacturing techniques (such as the other ones we’ve pointed out).  [Comparison 2.](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/air-jordan-1-logo-how-to-spot-fake-2-copy-1024x1024.jpg)  Over here we can notice that the fake letters are not bold  like in the previous comparison — but they’re also not getting the right amount of weight.  It seems like the fake Jordan logo here has very thin letters — so thin that in some cases they’re not completely legible. Notice the fake A’s horizontal line. Or the highlighted line in the “D” letter that’s thin and inconsistent.  At the same time  the “J” character seems to be different — it’s not only the letter’s shape  but also the sizing. For some reason  the fake “J” is taller than the other letters.  Moving on to the ™ character  the fake example in this case is too thick  quite the contrast from the previously analysed replica. The cause of this flaw is visible to the naked eye: it’s bigger than it’s supposed to be.  However  the most glaring flaw here is that the “wings” elements are too close to each other. So close that they’re touching and sometimes even overlapping.  >*If there’s one thing you need to keep in mind when it comes to telling real vs fake Air Jordan 1 logos  it’s this: the original shoe must have a high level of precision and detail.*  That is **the only thing** you need to spot: whether there are any small details that are not precise enough  which would be there as a consequence of compromises in quality.  I’m not saying Nike is never putting out imperfections  it’s just that they’re never letting pairs with *so many* imperfections leave the assembly line.  [Comparison 3](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/air-jordan-1-logo-legit-check-guide-1024x1024.jpg)  This used to be a very common flaw in the past but it’s been majorly fixed. However  most of the time  fake manufacturers fix a flaw and create 2 other flaws.  I was not surprised to see this inconsistency come back as soon as some other big ones were fixed on top-quality replicas.  The R and D in “JORDAN” should always be connected. It’s ironic how top-level fakes have this flaw again  in some cases.  That aside  our go-to thing still applies in this real vs fake comparison above: the wings elements are printed in a poorer manner — fuzzy lines and overlapping areas can be noticed.  # 2. Tongue tag  Up next  we’ll analyse what we usually look after when starting a guide: an element that’s small (therefore needs high-precision manufacturing tools) and hardly visible to anyone but the wearer.  The reason for our thinking is simple: these elements are where the replica manufacturers will compromise. The tongue tag is no exception and in fact I’m surprised myself that we didn’t start the guide with this flaw.  The Air Jordan logo is not perfected even though it’s visible on the outside of the sneaker. But I digress. Let’s have a look at how to spot the fake Jordan 1 this way:  [Comparison tongue tag](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/tongue-tag-air-jordan-1-real-vs-fake-1024x1024.jpg)  There are quite a few things we can look out for but the broad statement is that you need to be aware of two things:  1. A thinner font is used on the fake Air Jordan 1 tag 2. As a consequence  the font is sometimes illegible  The highlighted points show some quick giveaways for the thinner font  but the most important one is the “CHINA” text comparison.  As you can see  the “A” is not entirely legible in the fake example  while the H letter is wider. Naturally  it’s not easy for you to remember these things  so we recommend either coming back to this legitcheck’s guide pictures or keeping an eye out for weakly-printed text.  What do I mean by weakly printed text? Look at the highlighted french “VOTRE” on the Jordan 1 tag. Can you notice how the “E” is not entirely printed?  Maybe a better example is the “E” in “GARANTIE”  the neighbour word. If we compare that to the authentic example  yes  they’re not printed with the utmost precision — but we can see the difference in quality.  Worth mentioning as well is that this is a high-quality replica  thus wavy text does not occur as often as we’ll see soon — but even so  you can notice how the “SWOOSH ®” text is not straight on the fake Jordan tag.  # 3. Nike Swoosh  Enough with the micro-analyses  at least for the moment. Let’s head back to the visible parts of the sneaker.  We’ll have a look at the real vs fake Nike swoosh comparison for the Air Jordan 1.  [Comparison](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/swoosh-air-jordan-1-legit-check-guide-1024x1024.jpg)  It seems like the fake Jordans sometimes come with a bulky end of the Nike swoosh  when it’s supposed to be pointy.  There’s not much to say here besides the fact that it’s an instant callout for a fake pair  should you spot anything like this. Even on top tier replicas (won't name them as my plan is not to promote them) this flaw is present every now and then.  As you might've noticed with fakes  whenever there's a new batch that fixes a flaw  another very-obvious-and-rookie flaw is popping up. Seems like this flaw would be one of those.  # 4. Bulkiness of the shoe  Something replica creators seem to not get right is the overall shape of the sneaker  making it too bulky. Let’s have a look at this real vs fake Jordan 1 shape comparison below:  [Comparison](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/shape-air-jordan-1-fake-vs-real-guide-1024x1024.jpg)  The authentic example’s curvature (highlighted on the upper right side) is not something that you will find on every single original pair  so don’t take that as the go-to way every time.  However  most pairs have that kind of curvature  since they’re made using Nike’s higher-quality moulds.  But let’s leave that aside for a second. The bulkiness of the toe box is a more reliable factor. This is a flaw that is easy to spot when you have both the real and the fake pair next to each other — which 99.999% percent won’t have.  What you can remember though is the fact that  from the profile view  the toe box doesn’t have to come with a straight ascending line.  On the authentic pair  it seems like the toe box curves a tiny bit. As a consequence  highlighted in the lower left corner  the sneaker’s sole sits higher.  When we’re authenticating these sneakers  what we keep in mind is that the sole mustn’t be fantastically flat — and that’s all you need to know when it comes to auth.  checking the sole of the Air Jordan 1.  We’ve attached a second comparison of the AJ1 bulkier construction on the fakes so we can highlight the difference one more time:  [Comparison](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/shape-air-jordan-1-real-vs-fake-1024x1024.jpg)  # 5. Hourglass shape  Speaking of the shoe’s construction  we need to have a look from the rear for this following flaw on the fakes. This is a flaw that indeed is almost fixed on top-tier fakes  but most replicas are not those. Therefore  that  combined with how much time it would save if one knows this makes this flaw worthy of being higher in our top of flaws to look after.  It’s been commonly nicknamed as the “hourglass shape” tell and it’s easier for us to explain it visually with a comparison.  [Comparison](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/hourglass-shape-air-jordan-1-legit-check-guide-1024x1024.jpg)  And now the comparison with [drawn lines on top of the pics to make you understand better](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/hourglass-shape-air-jordan-1-real-vs-fake-1024x1024.jpg).  As you can see  the fake Air Jordan 1 is almost straight when it comes to this angle’s view. On the other hand  the original AJ1 is curving in two places: above and below the medial line.  Below the medial line  keep in mind that the sneaker has to have almost a bell-shaped bottom in order for it to be authentic.  Please note that this flaw is hard to spot when wearing the Jordans but it must be a dead giveaway for a fake.  Top-tier replicas sometimes get this thing right so it’s not the most reliable tell. Nonetheless  it might save you minutes when authenticating since the large majority of fakes are not from the top-tier category.  In other words  knowing this flaw will enable you to spot most of the fakes in a few seconds.

Air Jordan logo fake vs real  As you will see in the pictures below  fake manufacturers manage to replicate 90 to 98% of the logo right  but there are some shortcomings. [Comparison 1.](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/air-jordan-1-logo-real-vs-fake-1024x1024.jpg)  Broadly speaking we can point out two major things:  1. The authentic Jordan wings logo comes with thinner letters (except for the TM character) 2. At the same time  the overall quality of the print is lower on the fake.  We don’t want to leave it at this broad statement  so we’ll explain these two major flaws with the highlighted areas (highlighted with the hand emoji) and then we’re going to show some other comparisons.  Let’s start with the real vs fake Jordan logo comparison explanation from the left. The “A” character **is significantly thinner** on the authentic pair  but please **notice how the fake “A” outlines are also fuzzier.**  Up next  we want to point out how the “J” and “O” are not completely separate on the fake Air Jordan 1  whereas on the authentic AJ1 example there is definitely spacing between the two.  Ths same flaw can be noticed between “D” and “A” on the fake Air Jordan 1. If you’re wondering how to legitcheck Air Jordan 1’s  this is one of the fastest ways — look out for inconsistencies on the size tag  such as this one.  Coming up next  we’ve highlighted the “R” letter for the lack of precision on the fake example — once again  this is a compromise made by the fake manufacturers so that they can save money. This kind of flaw should never ever happen on an authentic pair.  And here’s one of the most important things on how to spot the fake Nike Air Jordan 1:  >*Pay attention to the spacing between these “wings” elements on the fake logo. Notice how there’s less space between elements on the authentic pair. On top of that  the fake elements are less defined (coming with fuzzier lines).*  Last but not least  it seems like the ™ character is too small on the replica Jordans and  as a consequence  thinner.  I wouldn’t base my authentication solely on the TM logo — rather  I’d be looking for some traits of lower quality manufacturing techniques (such as the other ones we’ve pointed out).  [Comparison 2.](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/air-jordan-1-logo-how-to-spot-fake-2-copy-1024x1024.jpg)  Over here we can notice that the fake letters are not bold  like in the previous comparison — but they’re also not getting the right amount of weight.  It seems like the fake Jordan logo here has very thin letters — so thin that in some cases they’re not completely legible. Notice the fake A’s horizontal line. Or the highlighted line in the “D” letter that’s thin and inconsistent.  At the same time  the “J” character seems to be different — it’s not only the letter’s shape  but also the sizing. For some reason  the fake “J” is taller than the other letters.  Moving on to the ™ character  the fake example in this case is too thick  quite the contrast from the previously analysed replica. The cause of this flaw is visible to the naked eye: it’s bigger than it’s supposed to be.  However  the most glaring flaw here is that the “wings” elements are too close to each other. So close that they’re touching and sometimes even overlapping.  >*If there’s one thing you need to keep in mind when it comes to telling real vs fake Air Jordan 1 logos  it’s this: the original shoe must have a high level of precision and detail.*  That is **the only thing** you need to spot: whether there are any small details that are not precise enough  which would be there as a consequence of compromises in quality.  I’m not saying Nike is never putting out imperfections  it’s just that they’re never letting pairs with *so many* imperfections leave the assembly line.  [Comparison 3](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/air-jordan-1-logo-legit-check-guide-1024x1024.jpg)  This used to be a very common flaw in the past but it’s been majorly fixed. However  most of the time  fake manufacturers fix a flaw and create 2 other flaws.  I was not surprised to see this inconsistency come back as soon as some other big ones were fixed on top-quality replicas.  The R and D in “JORDAN” should always be connected. It’s ironic how top-level fakes have this flaw again  in some cases.  That aside  our go-to thing still applies in this real vs fake comparison above: the wings elements are printed in a poorer manner — fuzzy lines and overlapping areas can be noticed.  # 2. Tongue tag  Up next  we’ll analyse what we usually look after when starting a guide: an element that’s small (therefore needs high-precision manufacturing tools) and hardly visible to anyone but the wearer.  The reason for our thinking is simple: these elements are where the replica manufacturers will compromise. The tongue tag is no exception and in fact I’m surprised myself that we didn’t start the guide with this flaw.  The Air Jordan logo is not perfected even though it’s visible on the outside of the sneaker. But I digress. Let’s have a look at how to spot the fake Jordan 1 this way:  [Comparison tongue tag](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/tongue-tag-air-jordan-1-real-vs-fake-1024x1024.jpg)  There are quite a few things we can look out for but the broad statement is that you need to be aware of two things:  1. A thinner font is used on the fake Air Jordan 1 tag 2. As a consequence  the font is sometimes illegible  The highlighted points show some quick giveaways for the thinner font  but the most important one is the “CHINA” text comparison.  As you can see  the “A” is not entirely legible in the fake example  while the H letter is wider. Naturally  it’s not easy for you to remember these things  so we recommend either coming back to this legitcheck’s guide pictures or keeping an eye out for weakly-printed text.  What do I mean by weakly printed text? Look at the highlighted french “VOTRE” on the Jordan 1 tag. Can you notice how the “E” is not entirely printed?  Maybe a better example is the “E” in “GARANTIE”  the neighbour word. If we compare that to the authentic example  yes  they’re not printed with the utmost precision — but we can see the difference in quality.  Worth mentioning as well is that this is a high-quality replica  thus wavy text does not occur as often as we’ll see soon — but even so  you can notice how the “SWOOSH ®” text is not straight on the fake Jordan tag.  # 3. Nike Swoosh  Enough with the micro-analyses  at least for the moment. Let’s head back to the visible parts of the sneaker.  We’ll have a look at the real vs fake Nike swoosh comparison for the Air Jordan 1.  [Comparison](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/swoosh-air-jordan-1-legit-check-guide-1024x1024.jpg)  It seems like the fake Jordans sometimes come with a bulky end of the Nike swoosh  when it’s supposed to be pointy.  There’s not much to say here besides the fact that it’s an instant callout for a fake pair  should you spot anything like this. Even on top tier replicas (won't name them as my plan is not to promote them) this flaw is present every now and then.  As you might've noticed with fakes  whenever there's a new batch that fixes a flaw  another very-obvious-and-rookie flaw is popping up. Seems like this flaw would be one of those.  # 4. Bulkiness of the shoe  Something replica creators seem to not get right is the overall shape of the sneaker  making it too bulky. Let’s have a look at this real vs fake Jordan 1 shape comparison below:  [Comparison](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/shape-air-jordan-1-fake-vs-real-guide-1024x1024.jpg)  The authentic example’s curvature (highlighted on the upper right side) is not something that you will find on every single original pair  so don’t take that as the go-to way every time.  However  most pairs have that kind of curvature  since they’re made using Nike’s higher-quality moulds.  But let’s leave that aside for a second. The bulkiness of the toe box is a more reliable factor. This is a flaw that is easy to spot when you have both the real and the fake pair next to each other — which 99.999% percent won’t have.  What you can remember though is the fact that  from the profile view  the toe box doesn’t have to come with a straight ascending line.  On the authentic pair  it seems like the toe box curves a tiny bit. As a consequence  highlighted in the lower left corner  the sneaker’s sole sits higher.  When we’re authenticating these sneakers  what we keep in mind is that the sole mustn’t be fantastically flat — and that’s all you need to know when it comes to auth.  checking the sole of the Air Jordan 1.  We’ve attached a second comparison of the AJ1 bulkier construction on the fakes so we can highlight the difference one more time:  [Comparison](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/shape-air-jordan-1-real-vs-fake-1024x1024.jpg)  # 5. Hourglass shape  Speaking of the shoe’s construction  we need to have a look from the rear for this following flaw on the fakes. This is a flaw that indeed is almost fixed on top-tier fakes  but most replicas are not those. Therefore  that  combined with how much time it would save if one knows this makes this flaw worthy of being higher in our top of flaws to look after.  It’s been commonly nicknamed as the “hourglass shape” tell and it’s easier for us to explain it visually with a comparison.  [Comparison](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/hourglass-shape-air-jordan-1-legit-check-guide-1024x1024.jpg)  And now the comparison with [drawn lines on top of the pics to make you understand better](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/hourglass-shape-air-jordan-1-real-vs-fake-1024x1024.jpg).  As you can see  the fake Air Jordan 1 is almost straight when it comes to this angle’s view. On the other hand  the original AJ1 is curving in two places: above and below the medial line.  Below the medial line  keep in mind that the sneaker has to have almost a bell-shaped bottom in order for it to be authentic.  Please note that this flaw is hard to spot when wearing the Jordans but it must be a dead giveaway for a fake.  Top-tier replicas sometimes get this thing right so it’s not the most reliable tell. Nonetheless  it might save you minutes when authenticating since the large majority of fakes are not from the top-tier category.  In other words  knowing this flaw will enable you to spot most of the fakes in a few seconds.  Let us finish this way of spotting fake Nike Air Jordan 1 [by dropping a second example  just to make everything clear.](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/hourglass-shape-air-jordan-1-fake-vs-real-1024x1024.jpg)  # Conclusion  Coming up next is a definitive complete L.C. guide for the...

[Comparison 2.](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/air-jordan-1-logo-how-to-spot-fake-2-copy-1024x1024.jpg)  Over here we can notice that the fake letters are not bold  like in the previous comparison — but they’re also not getting the right amount of weight.  It seems like the fake Jordan logo here has very thin letters — so thin that in some cases they’re not completely legible. Notice the fake A’s horizontal line. Or the highlighted line in the “D” letter that’s thin and inconsistent.  At the same time  the “J” character seems to be different — it’s not only the letter’s shape  but also the sizing. For some reason  the fake “J” is taller than the other letters.  Moving on to the ™ character  the fake example in this case is too thick  quite the contrast from the previously analysed replica. The cause of this flaw is visible to the naked eye: it’s bigger than it’s supposed to be.  However  the most glaring flaw here is that the “wings” elements are too close to each other. So close that they’re touching and sometimes even overlapping.  >*If there’s one thing you need to keep in mind when it comes to telling real vs fake Air Jordan 1 logos  it’s this: the original shoe must have a high level of precision and detail.*  That is **the only thing** you need to spot: whether there are any small details that are not precise enough  which would be there as a consequence of compromises in quality.  I’m not saying Nike is never putting out imperfections  it’s just that they’re never letting pairs with *so many* imperfections leave the assembly line.  [Comparison 3](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/air-jordan-1-logo-legit-check-guide-1024x1024.jpg)  This used to be a very common flaw in the past but it’s been majorly fixed. However  most of the time  fake manufacturers fix a flaw and create 2 other flaws.  I was not surprised to see this inconsistency come back as soon as some other big ones were fixed on top-quality replicas.  The R and D in “JORDAN” should always be connected. It’s ironic how top-level fakes have this flaw again  in some cases.  That aside  our go-to thing still applies in this real vs fake comparison above: the wings elements are printed in a poorer manner — fuzzy lines and overlapping areas can be noticed.  # 2. Tongue tag  Up next  we’ll analyse what we usually look after when starting a guide: an element that’s small (therefore needs high-precision manufacturing tools) and hardly visible to anyone but the wearer.  The reason for our thinking is simple: these elements are where the replica manufacturers will compromise. The tongue tag is no exception and in fact I’m surprised myself that we didn’t start the guide with this flaw.  The Air Jordan logo is not perfected even though it’s visible on the outside of the sneaker. But I digress. Let’s have a look at how to spot the fake Jordan 1 this way:  [Comparison tongue tag](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/tongue-tag-air-jordan-1-real-vs-fake-1024x1024.jpg)  There are quite a few things we can look out for but the broad statement is that you need to be aware of two things:  1. A thinner font is used on the fake Air Jordan 1 tag 2. As a consequence  the font is sometimes illegible  The highlighted points show some quick giveaways for the thinner font  but the most important one is the “CHINA” text comparison.  As you can see  the “A” is not entirely legible in the fake example  while the H letter is wider. Naturally  it’s not easy for you to remember these things  so we recommend either coming back to this legitcheck’s guide pictures or keeping an eye out for weakly-printed text.  What do I mean by weakly printed text? Look at the highlighted french “VOTRE” on the Jordan 1 tag. Can you notice how the “E” is not entirely printed?  Maybe a better example is the “E” in “GARANTIE”  the neighbour word. If we compare that to the authentic example  yes  they’re not printed with the utmost precision — but we can see the difference in quality.  Worth mentioning as well is that this is a high-quality replica  thus wavy text does not occur as often as we’ll see soon — but even so  you can notice how the “SWOOSH ®” text is not straight on the fake Jordan tag.  # 3. Nike Swoosh  Enough with the micro-analyses  at least for the moment. Let’s head back to the visible parts of the sneaker.  We’ll have a look at the real vs fake Nike swoosh comparison for the Air Jordan 1.  [Comparison](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/swoosh-air-jordan-1-legit-check-guide-1024x1024.jpg)  It seems like the fake Jordans sometimes come with a bulky end of the Nike swoosh  when it’s supposed to be pointy.  There’s not much to say here besides the fact that it’s an instant callout for a fake pair  should you spot anything like this. Even on top tier replicas (won't name them as my plan is not to promote them) this flaw is present every now and then.  As you might've noticed with fakes  whenever there's a new batch that fixes a flaw  another very-obvious-and-rookie flaw is popping up. Seems like this flaw would be one of those.  # 4. Bulkiness of the shoe  Something replica creators seem to not get right is the overall shape of the sneaker  making it too bulky. Let’s have a look at this real vs fake Jordan 1 shape comparison below:  [Comparison](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/shape-air-jordan-1-fake-vs-real-guide-1024x1024.jpg)  The authentic example’s curvature (highlighted on the upper right side) is not something that you will find on every single original pair  so don’t take that as the go-to way every time.  However  most pairs have that kind of curvature  since they’re made using Nike’s higher-quality moulds.  But let’s leave that aside for a second. The bulkiness of the toe box is a more reliable factor. This is a flaw that is easy to spot when you have both the real and the fake pair next to each other — which 99.999% percent won’t have.  What you can remember though is the fact that  from the profile view  the toe box doesn’t have to come with a straight ascending line.  On the authentic pair  it seems like the toe box curves a tiny bit. As a consequence  highlighted in the lower left corner  the sneaker’s sole sits higher.  When we’re authenticating these sneakers  what we keep in mind is that the sole mustn’t be fantastically flat — and that’s all you need to know when it comes to auth.  checking the sole of the Air Jordan 1.  We’ve attached a second comparison of the AJ1 bulkier construction on the fakes so we can highlight the difference one more time:  [Comparison](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/shape-air-jordan-1-real-vs-fake-1024x1024.jpg)  # 5. Hourglass shape  Speaking of the shoe’s construction  we need to have a look from the rear for this following flaw on the fakes. This is a flaw that indeed is almost fixed on top-tier fakes  but most replicas are not those. Therefore  that  combined with how much time it would save if one knows this makes this flaw worthy of being higher in our top of flaws to look after.  It’s been commonly nicknamed as the “hourglass shape” tell and it’s easier for us to explain it visually with a comparison.  [Comparison](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/hourglass-shape-air-jordan-1-legit-check-guide-1024x1024.jpg)  And now the comparison with [drawn lines on top of the pics to make you understand better](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/hourglass-shape-air-jordan-1-real-vs-fake-1024x1024.jpg).  As you can see  the fake Air Jordan 1 is almost straight when it comes to this angle’s view. On the other hand  the original AJ1 is curving in two places: above and below the medial line.  Below the medial line  keep in mind that the sneaker has to have almost a bell-shaped bottom in order for it to be authentic.  Please note that this flaw is hard to spot when wearing the Jordans but it must be a dead giveaway for a fake.  Top-tier replicas sometimes get this thing right so it’s not the most reliable tell. Nonetheless  it might save you minutes when authenticating since the large majority of fakes are not from the top-tier category.  In other words  knowing this flaw will enable you to spot most of the fakes in a few seconds.  Let us finish this way of spotting fake Nike Air Jordan 1 [by dropping a second example  just to make everything clear.](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/hourglass-shape-air-jordan-1-fake-vs-real-1024x1024.jpg)  # Conclusion  Coming up next is a definitive complete L.C. guide for the...

Anything you see that can be improved  lmk in the comments.  Also worth noting: we analyze the best fakes first  then dive into alternative batches. If it looks like we haven't analysed the best replica  there's a reason why we explained some other flaw on another version of the fake.  I need to drop this link here so that Google won't penalize the LegitCheck App's blog  thinking it's a duplicate. I recommend having a look there as well since there are 11 tells but below I'll list the topmost 5: [https://chdaniel.com/legitcheckapp/guides/air-jordan/fake-vs-real-universal-guide/](https://chdaniel.com/legitcheckapp/guides/air-jordan/fake-vs-real-universal-guide/)  Also  check the footer of this post where I put together all the previous Reddit posts (though you can find them all in the app as well)  Without any further ado...  # 1. Air Jordan logo fake vs real  As you will see in the pictures below  fake manufacturers manage to replicate 90 to 98% of the logo right  but there are some shortcomings. [Comparison 1.](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/air-jordan-1-logo-real-vs-fake-1024x1024.jpg)  Broadly speaking we can point out two major things:  1. The authentic Jordan wings logo comes with thinner letters (except for the TM character) 2. At the same time  the overall quality of the print is lower on the fake.  We don’t want to leave it at this broad statement  so we’ll explain these two major flaws with the highlighted areas (highlighted with the hand emoji) and then we’re going to show some other comparisons.  Let’s start with the real vs fake Jordan logo comparison explanation from the left. The “A” character **is significantly thinner** on the authentic pair  but please **notice how the fake “A” outlines are also fuzzier.**  Up next  we want to point out how the “J” and “O” are not completely separate on the fake Air Jordan 1  whereas on the authentic AJ1 example there is definitely spacing between the two.  Ths same flaw can be noticed between “D” and “A” on the fake Air Jordan 1. If you’re wondering how to legitcheck Air Jordan 1’s  this is one of the fastest ways — look out for inconsistencies on the size tag  such as this one.  Coming up next  we’ve highlighted the “R” letter for the lack of precision on the fake example — once again  this is a compromise made by the fake manufacturers so that they can save money. This kind of flaw should never ever happen on an authentic pair.  And here’s one of the most important things on how to spot the fake Nike Air Jordan 1:  >*Pay attention to the spacing between these “wings” elements on the fake logo. Notice how there’s less space between elements on the authentic pair.

Let’s have a look at how to spot the fake Jordan 1 this way:  [Comparison tongue tag](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/tongue-tag-air-jordan-1-real-vs-fake-1024x1024.jpg)  There are quite a few things we can look out for but the broad statement is that you need to be aware of two things:  1. A thinner font is used on the fake Air Jordan 1 tag 2. As a consequence  the font is sometimes illegible  The highlighted points show some quick giveaways for the thinner font  but the most important one is the “CHINA” text comparison.  As you can see  the “A” is not entirely legible in the fake example  while the H letter is wider. Naturally  it’s not easy for you to remember these things  so we recommend either coming back to this legitcheck’s guide pictures or keeping an eye out for weakly-printed text.  What do I mean by weakly printed text? Look at the highlighted french “VOTRE” on the Jordan 1 tag. Can you notice how the “E” is not entirely printed?  Maybe a better example is the “E” in “GARANTIE”  the neighbour word. If we compare that to the authentic example  yes  they’re not printed with the utmost precision — but we can see the difference in quality.  Worth mentioning as well is that this is a high-quality replica  thus wavy text does not occur as often as we’ll see soon — but even so  you can notice how the “SWOOSH ®” text is not straight on the fake Jordan tag.  # 3. Nike Swoosh  Enough with the micro-analyses  at least for the moment. Let’s head back to the visible parts of the sneaker.  We’ll have a look at the real vs fake Nike swoosh comparison for the Air Jordan 1.  [Comparison](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/swoosh-air-jordan-1-legit-check-guide-1024x1024.jpg)  It seems like the fake Jordans sometimes come with a bulky end of the Nike swoosh  when it’s supposed to be pointy.  There’s not much to say here besides the fact that it’s an instant callout for a fake pair  should you spot anything like this. Even on top tier replicas (won't name them as my plan is not to promote them) this flaw is present every now and then.  As you might've noticed with fakes  whenever there's a new batch that fixes a flaw  another very-obvious-and-rookie flaw is popping up. Seems like this flaw would be one of those.  # 4. Bulkiness of the shoe  Something replica creators seem to not get right is the overall shape of the sneaker  making it too bulky. Let’s have a look at this real vs fake Jordan 1 shape comparison below:  [Comparison](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/shape-air-jordan-1-fake-vs-real-guide-1024x1024.jpg)  The authentic example’s curvature (highlighted on the upper right side) is not something that you will find on every single original pair  so don’t take that as the go-to way every time.  However  most pairs have that kind of curvature  since they’re made using Nike’s higher-quality moulds.  But let’s leave that aside for a second. The bulkiness of the toe box is a more reliable factor. This is a flaw that is easy to spot when you have both the real and the fake pair next to each other — which 99.999% percent won’t have.  What you can remember though is the fact that  from the profile view  the toe box doesn’t have to come with a straight ascending line.  On the authentic pair  it seems like the toe box curves a tiny bit. As a consequence  highlighted in the lower left corner  the sneaker’s sole sits higher.  When we’re authenticating these sneakers  what we keep in mind is that the sole mustn’t be fantastically flat — and that’s all you need to know when it comes to auth.  checking the sole of the Air Jordan 1.  We’ve attached a second comparison of the AJ1 bulkier construction on the fakes so we can highlight the difference one more time:  [Comparison](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/shape-air-jordan-1-real-vs-fake-1024x1024.jpg)  # 5. Hourglass shape  Speaking of the shoe’s construction  we need to have a look from the rear for this following flaw on the fakes. This is a flaw that indeed is almost fixed on top-tier fakes  but most replicas are not those. Therefore  that  combined with how much time it would save if one knows this makes this flaw worthy of being higher in our top of flaws to look after.  It’s been commonly nicknamed as the “hourglass shape” tell and it’s easier for us to explain it visually with a comparison.  [Comparison](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/hourglass-shape-air-jordan-1-legit-check-guide-1024x1024.jpg)  And now the comparison with [drawn lines on top of the pics to make you understand better](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/hourglass-shape-air-jordan-1-real-vs-fake-1024x1024.jpg).  As you can see  the fake Air Jordan 1 is almost straight when it comes to this angle’s view. On the other hand  the original AJ1 is curving in two places: above and below the medial line.  Below the medial line  keep in mind that the sneaker has to have almost a bell-shaped bottom in order for it to be authentic.  Please note that this flaw is hard to spot when wearing the Jordans but it must be a dead giveaway for a fake.  Top-tier replicas sometimes get this thing right so it’s not the most reliable tell. Nonetheless  it might save you minutes when authenticating since the large majority of fakes are not from the top-tier category.  In other words  knowing this flaw will enable you to spot most of the fakes in a few seconds.  Let us finish this way of spotting fake Nike Air Jordan 1 [by dropping a second example  just to make everything clear.](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/hourglass-shape-air-jordan-1-fake-vs-real-1024x1024.jpg)  # Conclusion  Coming up next is a definitive complete L.C. guide for the...

Please remember  **this guide is meant to be an all around for most Jordan 1 releases**  so whatever you recommend has to apply to most colourways (exception: stuff like Satin SBB or other special releases). Anything you see that can be improved  lmk in the comments.  Also worth noting: we analyze the best fakes first  then dive into alternative batches. If it looks like we haven't analysed the best replica  there's a reason why we explained some other flaw on another version of the fake.  I need to drop this link here so that Google won't penalize the LegitCheck App's blog  thinking it's a duplicate. I recommend having a look there as well since there are 11 tells but below I'll list the topmost 5: [https://chdaniel.com/legitcheckapp/guides/air-jordan/fake-vs-real-universal-guide/](https://chdaniel.com/legitcheckapp/guides/air-jordan/fake-vs-real-universal-guide/)  Also  check the footer of this post where I put together all the previous Reddit posts (though you can find them all in the app as well)  Without any further ado...  # 1. Air Jordan logo fake vs real  As you will see in the pictures below  fake manufacturers manage to replicate 90 to 98% of the logo right  but there are some shortcomings. [Comparison 1.](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/air-jordan-1-logo-real-vs-fake-1024x1024.jpg)  Broadly speaking we can point out two major things:  1. The authentic Jordan wings logo comes with thinner letters (except for the TM character) 2. At the same time  the overall quality of the print is lower on the fake.  We don’t want to leave it at this broad statement  so we’ll explain these two major flaws with the highlighted areas (highlighted with the hand emoji) and then we’re going to show some other comparisons.  Let’s start with the real vs fake Jordan logo comparison explanation from the left. The “A” character **is significantly thinner** on the authentic pair  but please **notice how the fake “A” outlines are also fuzzier.**  Up next  we want to point out how the “J” and “O” are not completely separate on the fake Air Jordan 1  whereas on the authentic AJ1 example there is definitely spacing between the two.  Ths same flaw can be noticed between “D” and “A” on the fake Air Jordan 1. If you’re wondering how to legitcheck Air Jordan 1’s  this is one of the fastest ways — look out for inconsistencies on the size tag  such as this one.  Coming up next  we’ve highlighted the “R” letter for the lack of precision on the fake example — once again  this is a compromise made by the fake manufacturers so that they can save money. This kind of flaw should never ever happen on an authentic pair.  And here’s one of the most important things on how to spot the fake Nike Air Jordan 1:  >*Pay attention to the spacing between these “wings” elements on the fake logo. Notice how there’s less space between elements on the authentic pair. On top of that  the fake elements are less defined (coming with fuzzier lines).*  Last but not least  it seems like the ™ character is too small on the replica Jordans and  as a consequence  thinner.  I wouldn’t base my authentication solely on the TM logo — rather  I’d be looking for some traits of lower quality manufacturing techniques (such as the other ones we’ve pointed out).  [Comparison 2.](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/air-jordan-1-logo-how-to-spot-fake-2-copy-1024x1024.jpg)  Over here we can notice that the fake letters are not bold  like in the previous comparison — but they’re also not getting the right amount of weight.  It seems like the fake Jordan logo here has very thin letters — so thin that in some cases they’re not completely legible. Notice the fake A’s horizontal line. Or the highlighted line in the “D” letter that’s thin and inconsistent.  At the same time  the “J” character seems to be different — it’s not only the letter’s shape  but also the sizing. For some reason  the fake “J” is taller than the other letters.  Moving on to the ™ character  the fake example in this case is too thick  quite the contrast from the previously analysed replica. The cause of this flaw is visible to the naked eye: it’s bigger than it’s supposed to be.  However  the most glaring flaw here is that the “wings” elements are too close to each other. So close that they’re touching and sometimes even overlapping.  >*If there’s one thing you need to keep in mind when it comes to telling real vs fake Air Jordan 1 logos  it’s this: the original shoe must have a high level of precision and detail.*  That is **the only thing** you need to spot: whether there are any small details that are not precise enough  which would be there as a consequence of compromises in quality.  I’m not saying Nike is never putting out imperfections  it’s just that they’re never letting pairs with *so many* imperfections leave the assembly line.  [Comparison 3](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/air-jordan-1-logo-legit-check-guide-1024x1024.jpg)  This used to be a very common flaw in the past but it’s been majorly fixed. However  most of the time  fake manufacturers fix a flaw and create 2 other flaws.  I was not surprised to see this inconsistency come back as soon as some other big ones were fixed on top-quality replicas.  The R and D in “JORDAN” should always be connected. It’s ironic how top-level fakes have this flaw again  in some cases.  That aside  our go-to thing still applies in this real vs fake comparison above: the wings elements are printed in a poorer manner — fuzzy lines and overlapping areas can be noticed.  # 2. Tongue tag  Up next  we’ll analyse what we usually look after when starting a guide: an element that’s small (therefore needs high-precision manufacturing tools) and hardly visible to anyone but the wearer.  The reason for our thinking is simple: these elements are where the replica manufacturers will compromise. The tongue tag is no exception and in fact I’m surprised myself that we didn’t start the guide with this flaw.  The Air Jordan logo is not perfected even though it’s visible on the outside of the sneaker. But I digress.

However  most pairs have that kind of curvature  since they’re made using Nike’s higher-quality moulds.  But let’s leave that aside for a second. The bulkiness of the toe box is a more reliable factor. This is a flaw that is easy to spot when you have both the real and the fake pair next to each other — which 99.999% percent won’t have.  What you can remember though is the fact that  from the profile view  the toe box doesn’t have to come with a straight ascending line.  On the authentic pair  it seems like the toe box curves a tiny bit. As a consequence  highlighted in the lower left corner  the sneaker’s sole sits higher.  When we’re authenticating these sneakers  what we keep in mind is that the sole mustn’t be fantastically flat — and that’s all you need to know when it comes to auth.  checking the sole of the Air Jordan 1.  We’ve attached a second comparison of the AJ1 bulkier construction on the fakes so we can highlight the difference one more time:  [Comparison](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/shape-air-jordan-1-real-vs-fake-1024x1024.jpg)  # 5. Hourglass shape  Speaking of the shoe’s construction  we need to have a look from the rear for this following flaw on the fakes. This is a flaw that indeed is almost fixed on top-tier fakes  but most replicas are not those. Therefore  that  combined with how much time it would save if one knows this makes this flaw worthy of being higher in our top of flaws to look after.  It’s been commonly nicknamed as the “hourglass shape” tell and it’s easier for us to explain it visually with a comparison.  [Comparison](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/hourglass-shape-air-jordan-1-legit-check-guide-1024x1024.jpg)  And now the comparison with [drawn lines on top of the pics to make you understand better](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/hourglass-shape-air-jordan-1-real-vs-fake-1024x1024.jpg).  As you can see  the fake Air Jordan 1 is almost straight when it comes to this angle’s view. On the other hand  the original AJ1 is curving in two places: above and below the medial line.  Below the medial line  keep in mind that the sneaker has to have almost a bell-shaped bottom in order for it to be authentic.  Please note that this flaw is hard to spot when wearing the Jordans but it must be a dead giveaway for a fake.  Top-tier replicas sometimes get this thing right so it’s not the most reliable tell. Nonetheless  it might save you minutes when authenticating since the large majority of fakes are not from the top-tier category.  In other words  knowing this flaw will enable you to spot most of the fakes in a few seconds.  Let us finish this way of spotting fake Nike Air Jordan 1 [by dropping a second example  just to make everything clear.](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/hourglass-shape-air-jordan-1-fake-vs-real-1024x1024.jpg)  # Conclusion  Coming up next is a definitive complete L.C. guide for the...

1184,jzglt,[INSPO] Copped some new slides  thoughts?,Hello fellow JORDANheadz  I'm hoping you'll be able to help me make this resource even better  should you know your stuff.  Please remember  **this guide is meant to be an all around for most Jordan 1 releases**  so whatever you recommend has to apply to most colourways (exception: stuff like Satin SBB or other special releases). Anything you see that can be improved  lmk in the comments.  Also worth noting: we analyze the best fakes first  then dive into alternative batches. If it looks like we haven't analysed the best replica  there's a reason why we explained some other flaw on another version of the fake.  I need to drop this link here so that Google won't penalize the LegitCheck App's blog  thinking it's a duplicate. I recommend having a look there as well since there are 11 tells but below I'll list the topmost 5: [https://chdaniel.com/legitcheckapp/guides/air-jordan/fake-vs-real-universal-guide/](https://chdaniel.com/legitcheckapp/guides/air-jordan/fake-vs-real-universal-guide/)  Also  check the footer of this post where I put together all the previous Reddit posts (though you can find them all in the app as well)  Without any further ado...  # 1. Air Jordan logo fake vs real  As you will see in the pictures below  fake manufacturers manage to replicate 90 to 98% of the logo right  but there are some shortcomings. [Comparison 1.](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/air-jordan-1-logo-real-vs-fake-1024x1024.jpg)  Broadly speaking we can point out two major things:  1. The authentic Jordan wings logo comes with thinner letters (except for the TM character) 2. At the same time  the overall quality of the print is lower on the fake.  We don’t want to leave it at this broad statement  so we’ll explain these two major flaws with the highlighted areas (highlighted with the hand emoji) and then we’re going to show some other comparisons.  Let’s start with the real vs fake Jordan logo comparison explanation from the left. The “A” character **is significantly thinner** on the authentic pair  but please **notice how the fake “A” outlines are also fuzzier.**  Up next  we want to point out how the “J” and “O” are not completely separate on the fake Air Jordan 1  whereas on the authentic AJ1 example there is definitely spacing between the two.  Ths same flaw can be noticed between “D” and “A” on the fake Air Jordan 1. If you’re wondering how to legitcheck Air Jordan 1’s  this is one of the fastest ways — look out for inconsistencies on the size tag  such as this one.  Coming up next  we’ve highlighted the “R” letter for the lack of precision on the fake example — once again  this is a compromise made by the fake manufacturers so that they can save money. This kind of flaw should never ever happen on an authentic pair.  And here’s one of the most important things on how to spot the fake Nike Air Jordan 1:  >*Pay attention to the spacing between these “wings” elements on the fake logo. Notice how there’s less space between elements on the authentic pair. On top of that  the fake elements are less defined (coming with fuzzier lines).*  Last but not least  it seems like the ™ character is too small on the replica Jordans and  as a consequence  thinner.  I wouldn’t base my authentication solely on the TM logo — rather  I’d be looking for some traits of lower quality manufacturing techniques (such as the other ones we’ve pointed out).  [Comparison 2.](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/air-jordan-1-logo-how-to-spot-fake-2-copy-1024x1024.jpg)  Over here we can notice that the fake letters are not bold  like in the previous comparison — but they’re also not getting the right amount of weight.  It seems like the fake Jordan logo here has very thin letters — so thin that in some cases they’re not completely legible. Notice the fake A’s horizontal line. Or the highlighted line in the “D” letter that’s thin and inconsistent.  At the same time  the “J” character seems to be different — it’s not only the letter’s shape  but also the sizing. For some reason  the fake “J” is taller than the other letters.  Moving on to the ™ character  the fake example in this case is too thick  quite the contrast from the previously analysed replica. The cause of this flaw is visible to the naked eye: it’s bigger than it’s supposed to be.  However  the most glaring flaw here is that the “wings” elements are too close to each other. So close that they’re touching and sometimes even overlapping.  >*If there’s one thing you need to keep in mind when it comes to telling real vs fake Air Jordan 1 logos  it’s this: the original shoe must have a high level of precision and detail.*  That is **the only thing** you need to spot: whether there are any small details that are not precise enough  which would be there as a consequence of compromises in quality.  I’m not saying Nike is never putting out imperfections  it’s just that they’re never letting pairs with *so many* imperfections leave the assembly line.  [Comparison 3](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/air-jordan-1-logo-legit-check-guide-1024x1024.jpg)  This used to be a very common flaw in the past but it’s been majorly fixed. However  most of the time  fake manufacturers fix a flaw and create 2 other flaws.  I was not surprised to see this inconsistency come back as soon as some other big ones were fixed on top-quality replicas.  The R and D in “JORDAN” should always be connected. It’s ironic how top-level fakes have this flaw again  in some cases.  That aside  our go-to thing still applies in this real vs fake comparison above: the wings elements are printed in a poorer manner — fuzzy lines and overlapping areas can be noticed.  # 2. Tongue tag  Up next  we’ll analyse what we usually look after when starting a guide: an element that’s small (therefore needs high-precision manufacturing tools) and hardly visible to anyone but the wearer.  The reason for our thinking is simple: these elements are where the replica manufacturers will compromise. The tongue tag is no exception and in fact I’m surprised myself that we didn’t start the guide with this flaw.  The Air Jordan logo is not perfected even though it’s visible on the outside of the sneaker. But I digress. Let’s have a look at how to spot the fake Jordan 1 this way:  [Comparison tongue tag](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/tongue-tag-air-jordan-1-real-vs-fake-1024x1024.jpg)  There are quite a few things we can look out for but the broad statement is that you need to be aware of two things:  1. A thinner font is used on the fake Air Jordan 1 tag 2. As a consequence  the font is sometimes illegible  The highlighted points show some quick giveaways for the thinner font  but the most important one is the “CHINA” text comparison.  As you can see  the “A” is not entirely legible in the fake example  while the H letter is wider. Naturally  it’s not easy for you to remember these things  so we recommend either coming back to this legitcheck’s guide pictures or keeping an eye out for weakly-printed text.  What do I mean by weakly printed text? Look at the highlighted french “VOTRE” on the Jordan 1 tag. Can you notice how the “E” is not entirely printed?  Maybe a better example is the “E” in “GARANTIE”  the neighbour word. If we compare that to the authentic example  yes  they’re not printed with the utmost precision — but we can see the difference in quality.  Worth mentioning as well is that this is a high-quality replica  thus wavy text does not occur as often as we’ll see soon — but even so  you can notice how the “SWOOSH ®” text is not straight on the fake Jordan tag.  # 3. Nike Swoosh  Enough with the micro-analyses  at least for the moment. Let’s head back to the visible parts of the sneaker.  We’ll have a look at the real vs fake Nike swoosh comparison for the Air Jordan 1.  [Comparison](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/swoosh-air-jordan-1-legit-check-guide-1024x1024.jpg)  It seems like the fake Jordans sometimes come with a bulky end of the Nike swoosh  when it’s supposed to be pointy.  There’s not much to say here besides the fact that it’s an instant callout for a fake pair  should you spot anything like this. Even on top tier replicas (won't name them as my plan is not to promote them) this flaw is present every now and then.  As you might've noticed with fakes  whenever there's a new batch that fixes a flaw  another very-obvious-and-rookie flaw is popping up. Seems like this flaw would be one of those.  # 4. Bulkiness of the shoe  Something replica creators seem to not get right is the overall shape of the sneaker  making it too bulky. Let’s have a look at this real vs fake Jordan 1 shape comparison below:  [Comparison](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/shape-air-jordan-1-fake-vs-real-guide-1024x1024.jpg)  The authentic example’s curvature (highlighted on the upper right side) is not something that you will find on every single original pair  so don’t take that as the go-to way every time.

Nonetheless  it might save you minutes when authenticating since the large majority of fakes are not from the top-tier category.  In other words  knowing this flaw will enable you to spot most of the fakes in a few seconds.  Let us finish this way of spotting fake Nike Air Jordan 1 [by dropping a second example  just to make everything clear.](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/hourglass-shape-air-jordan-1-fake-vs-real-1024x1024.jpg)  # Conclusion  Coming up next is a definitive complete L.C. guide for the...

Please remember  **this guide is meant to be an all around for most Jordan 1 releases**  so whatever you recommend has to apply to most colourways (exception: stuff like Satin SBB or other special releases). Anything you see that can be improved  lmk in the comments.  Also worth noting: we analyze the best fakes first  then dive into alternative batches. If it looks like we haven't analysed the best replica  there's a reason why we explained some other flaw on another version of the fake.  I need to drop this link here so that Google won't penalize the LegitCheck App's blog  thinking it's a duplicate. I recommend having a look there as well since there are 11 tells but below I'll list the topmost 5: [https://chdaniel.com/legitcheckapp/guides/air-jordan/fake-vs-real-universal-guide/](https://chdaniel.com/legitcheckapp/guides/air-jordan/fake-vs-real-universal-guide/)  Also  check the footer of this post where I put together all the previous Reddit posts (though you can find them all in the app as well)  Without any further ado...  # 1. Air Jordan logo fake vs real  As you will see in the pictures below  fake manufacturers manage to replicate 90 to 98% of the logo right  but there are some shortcomings. [Comparison 1.](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/air-jordan-1-logo-real-vs-fake-1024x1024.jpg)  Broadly speaking we can point out two major things:  1. The authentic Jordan wings logo comes with thinner letters (except for the TM character) 2. At the same time  the overall quality of the print is lower on the fake.  We don’t want to leave it at this broad statement  so we’ll explain these two major flaws with the highlighted areas (highlighted with the hand emoji) and then we’re going to show some other comparisons.  Let’s start with the real vs fake Jordan logo comparison explanation from the left. The “A” character **is significantly thinner** on the authentic pair  but please **notice how the fake “A” outlines are also fuzzier.**  Up next  we want to point out how the “J” and “O” are not completely separate on the fake Air Jordan 1  whereas on the authentic AJ1 example there is definitely spacing between the two.  Ths same flaw can be noticed between “D” and “A” on the fake Air Jordan 1. If you’re wondering how to legitcheck Air Jordan 1’s  this is one of the fastest ways — look out for inconsistencies on the size tag  such as this one.  Coming up next  we’ve highlighted the “R” letter for the lack of precision on the fake example — once again  this is a compromise made by the fake manufacturers so that they can save money. This kind of flaw should never ever happen on an authentic pair.  And here’s one of the most important things on how to spot the fake Nike Air Jordan 1:  >*Pay attention to the spacing between these “wings” elements on the fake logo. Notice how there’s less space between elements on the authentic pair. On top of that  the fake elements are less defined (coming with fuzzier lines).*  Last but not least  it seems like the ™ character is too small on the replica Jordans and  as a consequence  thinner.  I wouldn’t base my authentication solely on the TM logo — rather  I’d be looking for some traits of lower quality manufacturing techniques (such as the other ones we’ve pointed out).  [Comparison 2.](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/air-jordan-1-logo-how-to-spot-fake-2-copy-1024x1024.jpg)  Over here we can notice that the fake letters are not bold  like in the previous comparison — but they’re also not getting the right amount of weight.  It seems like the fake Jordan logo here has very thin letters — so thin that in some cases they’re not completely legible. Notice the fake A’s horizontal line. Or the highlighted line in the “D” letter that’s thin and inconsistent.  At the same time  the “J” character seems to be different — it’s not only the letter’s shape  but also the sizing. For some reason  the fake “J” is taller than the other letters.  Moving on to the ™ character  the fake example in this case is too thick  quite the contrast from the previously analysed replica. The cause of this flaw is visible to the naked eye: it’s bigger than it’s supposed to be.  However  the most glaring flaw here is that the “wings” elements are too close to each other. So close that they’re touching and sometimes even overlapping.  >*If there’s one thing you need to keep in mind when it comes to telling real vs fake Air Jordan 1 logos  it’s this: the original shoe must have a high level of precision and detail.*  That is **the only thing** you need to spot: whether there are any small details that are not precise enough  which would be there as a consequence of compromises in quality.  I’m not saying Nike is never putting out imperfections  it’s just that they’re never letting pairs with *so many* imperfections leave the assembly line.  [Comparison 3](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/air-jordan-1-logo-legit-check-guide-1024x1024.jpg)  This used to be a very common flaw in the past but it’s been majorly fixed. However  most of the time  fake manufacturers fix a flaw and create 2 other flaws.  I was not surprised to see this inconsistency come back as soon as some other big ones were fixed on top-quality replicas.  The R and D in “JORDAN” should always be connected. It’s ironic how top-level fakes have this flaw again  in some cases.  That aside  our go-to thing still applies in this real vs fake comparison above: the wings elements are printed in a poorer manner — fuzzy lines and overlapping areas can be noticed.  # 2. Tongue tag  Up next  we’ll analyse what we usually look after when starting a guide: an element that’s small (therefore needs high-precision manufacturing tools) and hardly visible to anyone but the wearer.  The reason for our thinking is simple: these elements are where the replica manufacturers will compromise. The tongue tag is no exception and in fact I’m surprised myself that we didn’t start the guide with this flaw.  The Air Jordan logo is not perfected even though it’s visible on the outside of the sneaker. But I digress. Let’s have a look at how to spot the fake Jordan 1 this way:  [Comparison tongue tag](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/tongue-tag-air-jordan-1-real-vs-fake-1024x1024.jpg)  There are quite a few things we can look out for but the broad statement is that you need to be aware of two things:  1. A thinner font is used on the fake Air Jordan 1 tag 2. As a consequence  the font is sometimes illegible  The highlighted points show some quick giveaways for the thinner font  but the most important one is the “CHINA” text comparison.  As you can see  the “A” is not entirely legible in the fake example  while the H letter is wider. Naturally  it’s not easy for you to remember these things  so we recommend either coming back to this legitcheck’s guide pictures or keeping an eye out for weakly-printed text.  What do I mean by weakly printed text? Look at the highlighted french “VOTRE” on the Jordan 1 tag. Can you notice how the “E” is not entirely printed?  Maybe a better example is the “E” in “GARANTIE”  the neighbour word. If we compare that to the authentic example  yes  they’re not printed with the utmost precision — but we can see the difference in quality.  Worth mentioning as well is that this is a high-quality replica  thus wavy text does not occur as often as we’ll see soon — but even so  you can notice how the “SWOOSH ®” text is not straight on the fake Jordan tag.  # 3. Nike Swoosh  Enough with the micro-analyses  at least for the moment. Let’s head back to the visible parts of the sneaker.  We’ll have a look at the real vs fake Nike swoosh comparison for the Air Jordan 1.  [Comparison](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/swoosh-air-jordan-1-legit-check-guide-1024x1024.jpg)  It seems like the fake Jordans sometimes come with a bulky end of the Nike swoosh  when it’s supposed to be pointy.  There’s not much to say here besides the fact that it’s an instant callout for a fake pair  should you spot anything like this. Even on top tier replicas (won't name them as my plan is not to promote them) this flaw is present every now and then.  As you might've noticed with fakes  whenever there's a new batch that fixes a flaw  another very-obvious-and-rookie flaw is popping up. Seems like this flaw would be one of those.  # 4. Bulkiness of the shoe  Something replica creators seem to not get right is the overall shape of the sneaker  making it too bulky. Let’s have a look at this real vs fake Jordan 1 shape comparison below:  [Comparison](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/shape-air-jordan-1-fake-vs-real-guide-1024x1024.jpg)  The authentic example’s curvature (highlighted on the upper right side) is not something that you will find on every single original pair  so don’t take that as the go-to way every time.  However  most pairs have that kind of curvature  since they’re made using Nike’s higher-quality moulds.  But let’s leave that aside for a second. The bulkiness of the toe box is a more reliable factor. This is a flaw that is easy to spot when you have both the real and the fake pair next to each other — which 99.999% percent won’t have.  What you can remember though is the fact that  from the profile view  the toe box doesn’t have to come with a straight ascending line.  On the authentic pair  it seems like the toe box curves a tiny bit. As a consequence  highlighted in the lower left corner  the sneaker’s sole sits higher.  When we’re authenticating these sneakers  what we keep in mind is that the sole mustn’t be fantastically flat — and that’s all you need to know when it comes to auth.  checking the sole of the Air Jordan 1.  We’ve attached a second comparison of the AJ1 bulkier construction on the fakes so we can highlight the difference one more time:  [Comparison](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/shape-air-jordan-1-real-vs-fake-1024x1024.jpg)  # 5. Hourglass shape  Speaking of the shoe’s construction  we need to have a look from the rear for this following flaw on the fakes. This is a flaw that indeed is almost fixed on top-tier fakes  but most replicas are not those. Therefore  that  combined with how much time it would save if one knows this makes this flaw worthy of being higher in our top of flaws to look after.  It’s been commonly nicknamed as the “hourglass shape” tell and it’s easier for us to explain it visually with a comparison.  [Comparison](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/hourglass-shape-air-jordan-1-legit-check-guide-1024x1024.jpg)  And now the comparison with [drawn lines on top of the pics to make you understand better](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/hourglass-shape-air-jordan-1-real-vs-fake-1024x1024.jpg).  As you can see  the fake Air Jordan 1 is almost straight when it comes to this angle’s view. On the other hand  the original AJ1 is curving in two places: above and below the medial line.  Below the medial line  keep in mind that the sneaker has to have almost a bell-shaped bottom in order for it to be authentic.  Please note that this flaw is hard to spot when wearing the Jordans but it must be a dead giveaway for a fake.  Top-tier replicas sometimes get this thing right so it’s not the most reliable tell. Nonetheless  it might save you minutes when authenticating since the large majority of fakes are not from the top-tier category.

I recommend having a look there as well since there are 11 tells but below I'll list the topmost 5: [https://chdaniel.com/legitcheckapp/guides/air-jordan/fake-vs-real-universal-guide/](https://chdaniel.com/legitcheckapp/guides/air-jordan/fake-vs-real-universal-guide/)  Also  check the footer of this post where I put together all the previous Reddit posts (though you can find them all in the app as well)  Without any further ado...  # 1. Air Jordan logo fake vs real  As you will see in the pictures below  fake manufacturers manage to replicate 90 to 98% of the logo right  but there are some shortcomings. [Comparison 1.](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/air-jordan-1-logo-real-vs-fake-1024x1024.jpg)  Broadly speaking we can point out two major things:  1. The authentic Jordan wings logo comes with thinner letters (except for the TM character) 2. At the same time  the overall quality of the print is lower on the fake.  We don’t want to leave it at this broad statement  so we’ll explain these two major flaws with the highlighted areas (highlighted with the hand emoji) and then we’re going to show some other comparisons.  Let’s start with the real vs fake Jordan logo comparison explanation from the left. The “A” character **is significantly thinner** on the authentic pair  but please **notice how the fake “A” outlines are also fuzzier.**  Up next  we want to point out how the “J” and “O” are not completely separate on the fake Air Jordan 1  whereas on the authentic AJ1 example there is definitely spacing between the two.  Ths same flaw can be noticed between “D” and “A” on the fake Air Jordan 1. If you’re wondering how to legitcheck Air Jordan 1’s  this is one of the fastest ways — look out for inconsistencies on the size tag  such as this one.  Coming up next  we’ve highlighted the “R” letter for the lack of precision on the fake example — once again  this is a compromise made by the fake manufacturers so that they can save money. This kind of flaw should never ever happen on an authentic pair.  And here’s one of the most important things on how to spot the fake Nike Air Jordan 1:  >*Pay attention to the spacing between these “wings” elements on the fake logo. Notice how there’s less space between elements on the authentic pair. On top of that  the fake elements are less defined (coming with fuzzier lines).*  Last but not least  it seems like the ™ character is too small on the replica Jordans and  as a consequence  thinner.  I wouldn’t base my authentication solely on the TM logo — rather  I’d be looking for some traits of lower quality manufacturing techniques (such as the other ones we’ve pointed out).  [Comparison 2.](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/air-jordan-1-logo-how-to-spot-fake-2-copy-1024x1024.jpg)  Over here we can notice that the fake letters are not bold  like in the previous comparison — but they’re also not getting the right amount of weight.  It seems like the fake Jordan logo here has very thin letters — so thin that in some cases they’re not completely legible. Notice the fake A’s horizontal line. Or the highlighted line in the “D” letter that’s thin and inconsistent.  At the same time  the “J” character seems to be different — it’s not only the letter’s shape  but also the sizing. For some reason  the fake “J” is taller than the other letters.  Moving on to the ™ character  the fake example in this case is too thick  quite the contrast from the previously analysed replica. The cause of this flaw is visible to the naked eye: it’s bigger than it’s supposed to be.  However  the most glaring flaw here is that the “wings” elements are too close to each other. So close that they’re touching and sometimes even overlapping.  >*If there’s one thing you need to keep in mind when it comes to telling real vs fake Air Jordan 1 logos  it’s this: the original shoe must have a high level of precision and detail.*  That is **the only thing** you need to spot: whether there are any small details that are not precise enough  which would be there as a consequence of compromises in quality.  I’m not saying Nike is never putting out imperfections  it’s just that they’re never letting pairs with *so many* imperfections leave the assembly line.  [Comparison 3](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/air-jordan-1-logo-legit-check-guide-1024x1024.jpg)  This used to be a very common flaw in the past but it’s been majorly fixed. However  most of the time  fake manufacturers fix a flaw and create 2 other flaws.  I was not surprised to see this inconsistency come back as soon as some other big ones were fixed on top-quality replicas.  The R and D in “JORDAN” should always be connected. It’s ironic how top-level fakes have this flaw again  in some cases.  That aside  our go-to thing still applies in this real vs fake comparison above: the wings elements are printed in a poorer manner — fuzzy lines and overlapping areas can be noticed.  # 2. Tongue tag  Up next  we’ll analyse what we usually look after when starting a guide: an element that’s small (therefore needs high-precision manufacturing tools) and hardly visible to anyone but the wearer.  The reason for our thinking is simple: these elements are where the replica manufacturers will compromise. The tongue tag is no exception and in fact I’m surprised myself that we didn’t start the guide with this flaw.  The Air Jordan logo is not perfected even though it’s visible on the outside of the sneaker. But I digress. Let’s have a look at how to spot the fake Jordan 1 this way:  [Comparison tongue tag](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/tongue-tag-air-jordan-1-real-vs-fake-1024x1024.jpg)  There are quite a few things we can look out for but the broad statement is that you need to be aware of two things:  1. A thinner font is used on the fake Air Jordan 1 tag 2. As a consequence  the font is sometimes illegible  The highlighted points show some quick giveaways for the thinner font  but the most important one is the “CHINA” text comparison.  As you can see  the “A” is not entirely legible in the fake example  while the H letter is wider. Naturally  it’s not easy for you to remember these things  so we recommend either coming back to this legitcheck’s guide pictures or keeping an eye out for weakly-printed text.  What do I mean by weakly printed text? Look at the highlighted french “VOTRE” on the Jordan 1 tag. Can you notice how the “E” is not entirely printed?  Maybe a better example is the “E” in “GARANTIE”  the neighbour word. If we compare that to the authentic example  yes  they’re not printed with the utmost precision — but we can see the difference in quality.  Worth mentioning as well is that this is a high-quality replica  thus wavy text does not occur as often as we’ll see soon — but even so  you can notice how the “SWOOSH ®” text is not straight on the fake Jordan tag.  # 3. Nike Swoosh  Enough with the micro-analyses  at least for the moment. Let’s head back to the visible parts of the sneaker.  We’ll have a look at the real vs fake Nike swoosh comparison for the Air Jordan 1.  [Comparison](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/swoosh-air-jordan-1-legit-check-guide-1024x1024.jpg)  It seems like the fake Jordans sometimes come with a bulky end of the Nike swoosh  when it’s supposed to be pointy.  There’s not much to say here besides the fact that it’s an instant callout for a fake pair  should you spot anything like this. Even on top tier replicas (won't name them as my plan is not to promote them) this flaw is present every now and then.  As you might've noticed with fakes  whenever there's a new batch that fixes a flaw  another very-obvious-and-rookie flaw is popping up. Seems like this flaw would be one of those.  # 4. Bulkiness of the shoe  Something replica creators seem to not get right is the overall shape of the sneaker  making it too bulky. Let’s have a look at this real vs fake Jordan 1 shape comparison below:  [Comparison](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/shape-air-jordan-1-fake-vs-real-guide-1024x1024.jpg)  The authentic example’s curvature (highlighted on the upper right side) is not something that you will find on every single original pair  so don’t take that as the go-to way every time.  However  most pairs have that kind of curvature  since they’re made using Nike’s higher-quality moulds.  But let’s leave that aside for a second. The bulkiness of the toe box is a more reliable factor. This is a flaw that is easy to spot when you have both the real and the fake pair next to each other — which 99.999% percent won’t have.  What you can remember though is the fact that  from the profile view  the toe box doesn’t have to come with a straight ascending line.  On the authentic pair  it seems like the toe box curves a tiny bit. As a consequence  highlighted in the lower left corner  the sneaker’s sole sits higher.  When we’re authenticating these sneakers  what we keep in mind is that the sole mustn’t be fantastically flat — and that’s all you need to know when it comes to auth.  checking the sole of the Air Jordan 1.  We’ve attached a second comparison of the AJ1 bulkier construction on the fakes so we can highlight the difference one more time:  [Comparison](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/shape-air-jordan-1-real-vs-fake-1024x1024.jpg)  # 5. Hourglass shape  Speaking of the shoe’s construction  we need to have a look from the rear for this following flaw on the fakes. This is a flaw that indeed is almost fixed on top-tier fakes  but most replicas are not those. Therefore  that  combined with how much time it would save if one knows this makes this flaw worthy of being higher in our top of flaws to look after.  It’s been commonly nicknamed as the “hourglass shape” tell and it’s easier for us to explain it visually with a comparison.  [Comparison](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/hourglass-shape-air-jordan-1-legit-check-guide-1024x1024.jpg)  And now the comparison with [drawn lines on top of the pics to make you understand better](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/hourglass-shape-air-jordan-1-real-vs-fake-1024x1024.jpg).  As you can see  the fake Air Jordan 1 is almost straight when it comes to this angle’s view. On the other hand  the original AJ1 is curving in two places: above and below the medial line.  Below the medial line  keep in mind that the sneaker has to have almost a bell-shaped bottom in order for it to be authentic.  Please note that this flaw is hard to spot when wearing the Jordans but it must be a dead giveaway for a fake.  Top-tier replicas sometimes get this thing right so it’s not the most reliable tell. Nonetheless  it might save you minutes when authenticating since the large majority of fakes are not from the top-tier category.  In other words  knowing this flaw will enable you to spot most of the fakes in a few seconds.  Let us finish this way of spotting fake Nike Air Jordan 1 [by dropping a second example  just to make everything clear.](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/hourglass-shape-air-jordan-1-fake-vs-real-1024x1024.jpg)  # Conclusion  Coming up next is a definitive complete L.C. guide for the...

[Comparison 2.](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/air-jordan-1-logo-how-to-spot-fake-2-copy-1024x1024.jpg)  Over here we can notice that the fake letters are not bold  like in the previous comparison — but they’re also not getting the right amount of weight.  It seems like the fake Jordan logo here has very thin letters — so thin that in some cases they’re not completely legible. Notice the fake A’s horizontal line. Or the highlighted line in the “D” letter that’s thin and inconsistent.  At the same time  the “J” character seems to be different — it’s not only the letter’s shape  but also the sizing. For some reason  the fake “J” is taller than the other letters.  Moving on to the ™ character  the fake example in this case is too thick  quite the contrast from the previously analysed replica. The cause of this flaw is visible to the naked eye: it’s bigger than it’s supposed to be.  However  the most glaring flaw here is that the “wings” elements are too close to each other. So close that they’re touching and sometimes even overlapping.  >*If there’s one thing you need to keep in mind when it comes to telling real vs fake Air Jordan 1 logos  it’s this: the original shoe must have a high level of precision and detail.*  That is **the only thing** you need to spot: whether there are any small details that are not precise enough  which would be there as a consequence of compromises in quality.  I’m not saying Nike is never putting out imperfections  it’s just that they’re never letting pairs with *so many* imperfections leave the assembly line.  [Comparison 3](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/air-jordan-1-logo-legit-check-guide-1024x1024.jpg)  This used to be a very common flaw in the past but it’s been majorly fixed. However  most of the time  fake manufacturers fix a flaw and create 2 other flaws.  I was not surprised to see this inconsistency come back as soon as some other big ones were fixed on top-quality replicas.  The R and D in “JORDAN” should always be connected. It’s ironic how top-level fakes have this flaw again  in some cases.  That aside  our go-to thing still applies in this real vs fake comparison above: the wings elements are printed in a poorer manner — fuzzy lines and overlapping areas can be noticed.  # 2. Tongue tag  Up next  we’ll analyse what we usually look after when starting a guide: an element that’s small (therefore needs high-precision manufacturing tools) and hardly visible to anyone but the wearer.  The reason for our thinking is simple: these elements are where the replica manufacturers will compromise. The tongue tag is no exception and in fact I’m surprised myself that we didn’t start the guide with this flaw.  The Air Jordan logo is not perfected even though it’s visible on the outside of the sneaker. But I digress. Let’s have a look at how to spot the fake Jordan 1 this way:  [Comparison tongue tag](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/tongue-tag-air-jordan-1-real-vs-fake-1024x1024.jpg)  There are quite a few things we can look out for but the broad statement is that you need to be aware of two things:  1. A thinner font is used on the fake Air Jordan 1 tag 2. As a consequence  the font is sometimes illegible  The highlighted points show some quick giveaways for the thinner font  but the most important one is the “CHINA” text comparison.  As you can see  the “A” is not entirely legible in the fake example  while the H letter is wider. Naturally  it’s not easy for you to remember these things  so we recommend either coming back to this legitcheck’s guide pictures or keeping an eye out for weakly-printed text.  What do I mean by weakly printed text? Look at the highlighted french “VOTRE” on the Jordan 1 tag. Can you notice how the “E” is not entirely printed?  Maybe a better example is the “E” in “GARANTIE”  the neighbour word. If we compare that to the authentic example  yes  they’re not printed with the utmost precision — but we can see the difference in quality.  Worth mentioning as well is that this is a high-quality replica  thus wavy text does not occur as often as we’ll see soon — but even so  you can notice how the “SWOOSH ®” text is not straight on the fake Jordan tag.  # 3. Nike Swoosh  Enough with the micro-analyses  at least for the moment. Let’s head back to the visible parts of the sneaker.  We’ll have a look at the real vs fake Nike swoosh comparison for the Air Jordan 1.  [Comparison](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/swoosh-air-jordan-1-legit-check-guide-1024x1024.jpg)  It seems like the fake Jordans sometimes come with a bulky end of the Nike swoosh  when it’s supposed to be pointy.  There’s not much to say here besides the fact that it’s an instant callout for a fake pair  should you spot anything like this. Even on top tier replicas (won't name them as my plan is not to promote them) this flaw is present every now and then.  As you might've noticed with fakes  whenever there's a new batch that fixes a flaw  another very-obvious-and-rookie flaw is popping up. Seems like this flaw would be one of those.  # 4. Bulkiness of the shoe  Something replica creators seem to not get right is the overall shape of the sneaker  making it too bulky. Let’s have a look at this real vs fake Jordan 1 shape comparison below:  [Comparison](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/shape-air-jordan-1-fake-vs-real-guide-1024x1024.jpg)  The authentic example’s curvature (highlighted on the upper right side) is not something that you will find on every single original pair  so don’t take that as the go-to way every time.  However  most pairs have that kind of curvature  since they’re made using Nike’s higher-quality moulds.  But let’s leave that aside for a second. The bulkiness of the toe box is a more reliable factor. This is a flaw that is easy to spot when you have both the real and the fake pair next to each other — which 99.999% percent won’t have.  What you can remember though is the fact that  from the profile view  the toe box doesn’t have to come with a straight ascending line.  On the authentic pair  it seems like the toe box curves a tiny bit. As a consequence  highlighted in the lower left corner  the sneaker’s sole sits higher.  When we’re authenticating these sneakers  what we keep in mind is that the sole mustn’t be fantastically flat — and that’s all you need to know when it comes to auth.  checking the sole of the Air Jordan 1.  We’ve attached a second comparison of the AJ1 bulkier construction on the fakes so we can highlight the difference one more time:  [Comparison](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/shape-air-jordan-1-real-vs-fake-1024x1024.jpg)  # 5. Hourglass shape  Speaking of the shoe’s construction  we need to have a look from the rear for this following flaw on the fakes. This is a flaw that indeed is almost fixed on top-tier fakes  but most replicas are not those. Therefore  that  combined with how much time it would save if one knows this makes this flaw worthy of being higher in our top of flaws to look after.  It’s been commonly nicknamed as the “hourglass shape” tell and it’s easier for us to explain it visually with a comparison.  [Comparison](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/hourglass-shape-air-jordan-1-legit-check-guide-1024x1024.jpg)  And now the comparison with [drawn lines on top of the pics to make you understand better](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/hourglass-shape-air-jordan-1-real-vs-fake-1024x1024.jpg).  As you can see  the fake Air Jordan 1 is almost straight when it comes to this angle’s view. On the other hand  the original AJ1 is curving in two places: above and below the medial line.  Below the medial line  keep in mind that the sneaker has to have almost a bell-shaped bottom in order for it to be authentic.  Please note that this flaw is hard to spot when wearing the Jordans but it must be a dead giveaway for a fake.  Top-tier replicas sometimes get this thing right so it’s not the most reliable tell. Nonetheless  it might save you minutes when authenticating since the large majority of fakes are not from the top-tier category.  In other words  knowing this flaw will enable you to spot most of the fakes in a few seconds.  Let us finish this way of spotting fake Nike Air Jordan 1 [by dropping a second example  just to make everything clear.](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/hourglass-shape-air-jordan-1-fake-vs-real-1024x1024.jpg)  # Conclusion  Coming up next is a definitive complete L.C. guide for the...

Please remember  **this guide is meant to be an all around for most Jordan 1 releases**  so whatever you recommend has to apply to most colourways (exception: stuff like Satin SBB or other special releases). Anything you see that can be improved  lmk in the comments.  Also worth noting: we analyze the best fakes first  then dive into alternative batches. If it looks like we haven't analysed the best replica  there's a reason why we explained some other flaw on another version of the fake.  I need to drop this link here so that Google won't penalize the LegitCheck App's blog  thinking it's a duplicate. I recommend having a look there as well since there are 11 tells but below I'll list the topmost 5: [https://chdaniel.com/legitcheckapp/guides/air-jordan/fake-vs-real-universal-guide/](https://chdaniel.com/legitcheckapp/guides/air-jordan/fake-vs-real-universal-guide/)  Also  check the footer of this post where I put together all the previous Reddit posts (though you can find them all in the app as well)  Without any further ado...  # 1. Air Jordan logo fake vs real  As you will see in the pictures below  fake manufacturers manage to replicate 90 to 98% of the logo right  but there are some shortcomings. [Comparison 1.](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/air-jordan-1-logo-real-vs-fake-1024x1024.jpg)  Broadly speaking we can point out two major things:  1. The authentic Jordan wings logo comes with thinner letters (except for the TM character) 2. At the same time  the overall quality of the print is lower on the fake.  We don’t want to leave it at this broad statement  so we’ll explain these two major flaws with the highlighted areas (highlighted with the hand emoji) and then we’re going to show some other comparisons.  Let’s start with the real vs fake Jordan logo comparison explanation from the left. The “A” character **is significantly thinner** on the authentic pair  but please **notice how the fake “A” outlines are also fuzzier.**  Up next  we want to point out how the “J” and “O” are not completely separate on the fake Air Jordan 1  whereas on the authentic AJ1 example there is definitely spacing between the two.  Ths same flaw can be noticed between “D” and “A” on the fake Air Jordan 1. If you’re wondering how to legitcheck Air Jordan 1’s  this is one of the fastest ways — look out for inconsistencies on the size tag  such as this one.  Coming up next  we’ve highlighted the “R” letter for the lack of precision on the fake example — once again  this is a compromise made by the fake manufacturers so that they can save money. This kind of flaw should never ever happen on an authentic pair.  And here’s one of the most important things on how to spot the fake Nike Air Jordan 1:  >*Pay attention to the spacing between these “wings” elements on the fake logo. Notice how there’s less space between elements on the authentic pair.

Let’s have a look at how to spot the fake Jordan 1 this way:  [Comparison tongue tag](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/tongue-tag-air-jordan-1-real-vs-fake-1024x1024.jpg)  There are quite a few things we can look out for but the broad statement is that you need to be aware of two things:  1. A thinner font is used on the fake Air Jordan 1 tag 2. As a consequence  the font is sometimes illegible  The highlighted points show some quick giveaways for the thinner font  but the most important one is the “CHINA” text comparison.  As you can see  the “A” is not entirely legible in the fake example  while the H letter is wider. Naturally  it’s not easy for you to remember these things  so we recommend either coming back to this legitcheck’s guide pictures or keeping an eye out for weakly-printed text.  What do I mean by weakly printed text? Look at the highlighted french “VOTRE” on the Jordan 1 tag. Can you notice how the “E” is not entirely printed?  Maybe a better example is the “E” in “GARANTIE”  the neighbour word. If we compare that to the authentic example  yes  they’re not printed with the utmost precision — but we can see the difference in quality.  Worth mentioning as well is that this is a high-quality replica  thus wavy text does not occur as often as we’ll see soon — but even so  you can notice how the “SWOOSH ®” text is not straight on the fake Jordan tag.  # 3. Nike Swoosh  Enough with the micro-analyses  at least for the moment. Let’s head back to the visible parts of the sneaker.  We’ll have a look at the real vs fake Nike swoosh comparison for the Air Jordan 1.  [Comparison](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/swoosh-air-jordan-1-legit-check-guide-1024x1024.jpg)  It seems like the fake Jordans sometimes come with a bulky end of the Nike swoosh  when it’s supposed to be pointy.  There’s not much to say here besides the fact that it’s an instant callout for a fake pair  should you spot anything like this. Even on top tier replicas (won't name them as my plan is not to promote them) this flaw is present every now and then.  As you might've noticed with fakes  whenever there's a new batch that fixes a flaw  another very-obvious-and-rookie flaw is popping up. Seems like this flaw would be one of those.  # 4. Bulkiness of the shoe  Something replica creators seem to not get right is the overall shape of the sneaker  making it too bulky. Let’s have a look at this real vs fake Jordan 1 shape comparison below:  [Comparison](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/shape-air-jordan-1-fake-vs-real-guide-1024x1024.jpg)  The authentic example’s curvature (highlighted on the upper right side) is not something that you will find on every single original pair  so don’t take that as the go-to way every time.  However  most pairs have that kind of curvature  since they’re made using Nike’s higher-quality moulds.  But let’s leave that aside for a second. The bulkiness of the toe box is a more reliable factor. This is a flaw that is easy to spot when you have both the real and the fake pair next to each other — which 99.999% percent won’t have.  What you can remember though is the fact that  from the profile view  the toe box doesn’t have to come with a straight ascending line.  On the authentic pair  it seems like the toe box curves a tiny bit. As a consequence  highlighted in the lower left corner  the sneaker’s sole sits higher.  When we’re authenticating these sneakers  what we keep in mind is that the sole mustn’t be fantastically flat — and that’s all you need to know when it comes to auth.  checking the sole of the Air Jordan 1.  We’ve attached a second comparison of the AJ1 bulkier construction on the fakes so we can highlight the difference one more time:  [Comparison](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/shape-air-jordan-1-real-vs-fake-1024x1024.jpg)  # 5. Hourglass shape  Speaking of the shoe’s construction  we need to have a look from the rear for this following flaw on the fakes. This is a flaw that indeed is almost fixed on top-tier fakes  but most replicas are not those. Therefore  that  combined with how much time it would save if one knows this makes this flaw worthy of being higher in our top of flaws to look after.  It’s been commonly nicknamed as the “hourglass shape” tell and it’s easier for us to explain it visually with a comparison.  [Comparison](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/hourglass-shape-air-jordan-1-legit-check-guide-1024x1024.jpg)  And now the comparison with [drawn lines on top of the pics to make you understand better](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/hourglass-shape-air-jordan-1-real-vs-fake-1024x1024.jpg).  As you can see  the fake Air Jordan 1 is almost straight when it comes to this angle’s view. On the other hand  the original AJ1 is curving in two places: above and below the medial line.  Below the medial line  keep in mind that the sneaker has to have almost a bell-shaped bottom in order for it to be authentic.  Please note that this flaw is hard to spot when wearing the Jordans but it must be a dead giveaway for a fake.  Top-tier replicas sometimes get this thing right so it’s not the most reliable tell. Nonetheless  it might save you minutes when authenticating since the large majority of fakes are not from the top-tier category.  In other words  knowing this flaw will enable you to spot most of the fakes in a few seconds.  Let us finish this way of spotting fake Nike Air Jordan 1 [by dropping a second example  just to make everything clear.](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/hourglass-shape-air-jordan-1-fake-vs-real-1024x1024.jpg)  # Conclusion  Coming up next is a definitive complete L.C. guide for the...

1193,jzglt,[INSPO] Copped some new slides  thoughts?,Hello fellow JORDANheadz  I'm hoping you'll be able to help me make this resource even better  should you know your stuff.  Please remember  **this guide is meant to be an all around for most Jordan 1 releases**  so whatever you recommend has to apply to most colourways (exception: stuff like Satin SBB or other special releases). Anything you see that can be improved  lmk in the comments.  Also worth noting: we analyze the best fakes first  then dive into alternative batches. If it looks like we haven't analysed the best replica  there's a reason why we explained some other flaw on another version of the fake.  I need to drop this link here so that Google won't penalize the LegitCheck App's blog  thinking it's a duplicate. I recommend having a look there as well since there are 11 tells but below I'll list the topmost 5: [https://chdaniel.com/legitcheckapp/guides/air-jordan/fake-vs-real-universal-guide/](https://chdaniel.com/legitcheckapp/guides/air-jordan/fake-vs-real-universal-guide/)  Also  check the footer of this post where I put together all the previous Reddit posts (though you can find them all in the app as well)  Without any further ado...  # 1. Air Jordan logo fake vs real  As you will see in the pictures below  fake manufacturers manage to replicate 90 to 98% of the logo right  but there are some shortcomings. [Comparison 1.](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/air-jordan-1-logo-real-vs-fake-1024x1024.jpg)  Broadly speaking we can point out two major things:  1. The authentic Jordan wings logo comes with thinner letters (except for the TM character) 2. At the same time  the overall quality of the print is lower on the fake.  We don’t want to leave it at this broad statement  so we’ll explain these two major flaws with the highlighted areas (highlighted with the hand emoji) and then we’re going to show some other comparisons.  Let’s start with the real vs fake Jordan logo comparison explanation from the left. The “A” character **is significantly thinner** on the authentic pair  but please **notice how the fake “A” outlines are also fuzzier.**  Up next  we want to point out how the “J” and “O” are not completely separate on the fake Air Jordan 1  whereas on the authentic AJ1 example there is definitely spacing between the two.  Ths same flaw can be noticed between “D” and “A” on the fake Air Jordan 1. If you’re wondering how to legitcheck Air Jordan 1’s  this is one of the fastest ways — look out for inconsistencies on the size tag  such as this one.  Coming up next  we’ve highlighted the “R” letter for the lack of precision on the fake example — once again  this is a compromise made by the fake manufacturers so that they can save money. This kind of flaw should never ever happen on an authentic pair.  And here’s one of the most important things on how to spot the fake Nike Air Jordan 1:  >*Pay attention to the spacing between these “wings” elements on the fake logo. Notice how there’s less space between elements on the authentic pair. On top of that  the fake elements are less defined (coming with fuzzier lines).*  Last but not least  it seems like the ™ character is too small on the replica Jordans and  as a consequence  thinner.  I wouldn’t base my authentication solely on the TM logo — rather  I’d be looking for some traits of lower quality manufacturing techniques (such as the other ones we’ve pointed out).  [Comparison 2.](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/air-jordan-1-logo-how-to-spot-fake-2-copy-1024x1024.jpg)  Over here we can notice that the fake letters are not bold  like in the previous comparison — but they’re also not getting the right amount of weight.  It seems like the fake Jordan logo here has very thin letters — so thin that in some cases they’re not completely legible. Notice the fake A’s horizontal line. Or the highlighted line in the “D” letter that’s thin and inconsistent.  At the same time  the “J” character seems to be different — it’s not only the letter’s shape  but also the sizing. For some reason  the fake “J” is taller than the other letters.  Moving on to the ™ character  the fake example in this case is too thick  quite the contrast from the previously analysed replica. The cause of this flaw is visible to the naked eye: it’s bigger than it’s supposed to be.  However  the most glaring flaw here is that the “wings” elements are too close to each other. So close that they’re touching and sometimes even overlapping.  >*If there’s one thing you need to keep in mind when it comes to telling real vs fake Air Jordan 1 logos  it’s this: the original shoe must have a high level of precision and detail.*  That is **the only thing** you need to spot: whether there are any small details that are not precise enough  which would be there as a consequence of compromises in quality.  I’m not saying Nike is never putting out imperfections  it’s just that they’re never letting pairs with *so many* imperfections leave the assembly line.  [Comparison 3](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/air-jordan-1-logo-legit-check-guide-1024x1024.jpg)  This used to be a very common flaw in the past but it’s been majorly fixed. However  most of the time  fake manufacturers fix a flaw and create 2 other flaws.  I was not surprised to see this inconsistency come back as soon as some other big ones were fixed on top-quality replicas.  The R and D in “JORDAN” should always be connected. It’s ironic how top-level fakes have this flaw again  in some cases.  That aside  our go-to thing still applies in this real vs fake comparison above: the wings elements are printed in a poorer manner — fuzzy lines and overlapping areas can be noticed.  # 2. Tongue tag  Up next  we’ll analyse what we usually look after when starting a guide: an element that’s small (therefore needs high-precision manufacturing tools) and hardly visible to anyone but the wearer.  The reason for our thinking is simple: these elements are where the replica manufacturers will compromise. The tongue tag is no exception and in fact I’m surprised myself that we didn’t start the guide with this flaw.  The Air Jordan logo is not perfected even though it’s visible on the outside of the sneaker. But I digress.

Let’s have a look at this real vs fake Jordan 1 shape comparison below:  [Comparison](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/shape-air-jordan-1-fake-vs-real-guide-1024x1024.jpg)  The authentic example’s curvature (highlighted on the upper right side) is not something that you will find on every single original pair  so don’t take that as the go-to way every time.  However  most pairs have that kind of curvature  since they’re made using Nike’s higher-quality moulds.  But let’s leave that aside for a second. The bulkiness of the toe box is a more reliable factor. This is a flaw that is easy to spot when you have both the real and the fake pair next to each other — which 99.999% percent won’t have.  What you can remember though is the fact that  from the profile view  the toe box doesn’t have to come with a straight ascending line.  On the authentic pair  it seems like the toe box curves a tiny bit. As a consequence  highlighted in the lower left corner  the sneaker’s sole sits higher.  When we’re authenticating these sneakers  what we keep in mind is that the sole mustn’t be fantastically flat — and that’s all you need to know when it comes to auth.  checking the sole of the Air Jordan 1.  We’ve attached a second comparison of the AJ1 bulkier construction on the fakes so we can highlight the difference one more time:  [Comparison](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/shape-air-jordan-1-real-vs-fake-1024x1024.jpg)  # 5. Hourglass shape  Speaking of the shoe’s construction  we need to have a look from the rear for this following flaw on the fakes. This is a flaw that indeed is almost fixed on top-tier fakes  but most replicas are not those. Therefore  that  combined with how much time it would save if one knows this makes this flaw worthy of being higher in our top of flaws to look after.  It’s been commonly nicknamed as the “hourglass shape” tell and it’s easier for us to explain it visually with a comparison.  [Comparison](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/hourglass-shape-air-jordan-1-legit-check-guide-1024x1024.jpg)  And now the comparison with [drawn lines on top of the pics to make you understand better](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/hourglass-shape-air-jordan-1-real-vs-fake-1024x1024.jpg).  As you can see  the fake Air Jordan 1 is almost straight when it comes to this angle’s view. On the other hand  the original AJ1 is curving in two places: above and below the medial line.  Below the medial line  keep in mind that the sneaker has to have almost a bell-shaped bottom in order for it to be authentic.  Please note that this flaw is hard to spot when wearing the Jordans but it must be a dead giveaway for a fake.  Top-tier replicas sometimes get this thing right so it’s not the most reliable tell. Nonetheless  it might save you minutes when authenticating since the large majority of fakes are not from the top-tier category.  In other words  knowing this flaw will enable you to spot most of the fakes in a few seconds.  Let us finish this way of spotting fake Nike Air Jordan 1 [by dropping a second example  just to make everything clear.](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/hourglass-shape-air-jordan-1-fake-vs-real-1024x1024.jpg)  # Conclusion  Coming up next is a definitive complete L.C. guide for the...

1195,onlygeo,[REVIEW] I couldn’t find a single review on the every hero boots so i decided to do one myself these are a great slp Wyatt alternative,Hello fellow JORDANheadz  I'm hoping you'll be able to help me make this resource even better  should you know your stuff.  Please remember  **this guide is meant to be an all around for most Jordan 1 releases**  so whatever you recommend has to apply to most colourways (exception: stuff like Satin SBB or other special releases). Anything you see that can be improved  lmk in the comments.  Also worth noting: we analyze the best fakes first  then dive into alternative batches. If it looks like we haven't analysed the best replica  there's a reason why we explained some other flaw on another version of the fake.  I need to drop this link here so that Google won't penalize the LegitCheck App's blog  thinking it's a duplicate. I recommend having a look there as well since there are 11 tells but below I'll list the topmost 5: [https://chdaniel.com/legitcheckapp/guides/air-jordan/fake-vs-real-universal-guide/](https://chdaniel.com/legitcheckapp/guides/air-jordan/fake-vs-real-universal-guide/)  Also  check the footer of this post where I put together all the previous Reddit posts (though you can find them all in the app as well)  Without any further ado...  # 1. Air Jordan logo fake vs real  As you will see in the pictures below  fake manufacturers manage to replicate 90 to 98% of the logo right  but there are some shortcomings. [Comparison 1.](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/air-jordan-1-logo-real-vs-fake-1024x1024.jpg)  Broadly speaking we can point out two major things:  1. The authentic Jordan wings logo comes with thinner letters (except for the TM character) 2. At the same time  the overall quality of the print is lower on the fake.  We don’t want to leave it at this broad statement  so we’ll explain these two major flaws with the highlighted areas (highlighted with the hand emoji) and then we’re going to show some other comparisons.  Let’s start with the real vs fake Jordan logo comparison explanation from the left. The “A” character **is significantly thinner** on the authentic pair  but please **notice how the fake “A” outlines are also fuzzier.**  Up next  we want to point out how the “J” and “O” are not completely separate on the fake Air Jordan 1  whereas on the authentic AJ1 example there is definitely spacing between the two.  Ths same flaw can be noticed between “D” and “A” on the fake Air Jordan 1. If you’re wondering how to legitcheck Air Jordan 1’s  this is one of the fastest ways — look out for inconsistencies on the size tag  such as this one.  Coming up next  we’ve highlighted the “R” letter for the lack of precision on the fake example — once again  this is a compromise made by the fake manufacturers so that they can save money. This kind of flaw should never ever happen on an authentic pair.  And here’s one of the most important things on how to spot the fake Nike Air Jordan 1:  >*Pay attention to the spacing between these “wings” elements on the fake logo. Notice how there’s less space between elements on the authentic pair. On top of that  the fake elements are less defined (coming with fuzzier lines).*  Last but not least  it seems like the ™ character is too small on the replica Jordans and  as a consequence  thinner.  I wouldn’t base my authentication solely on the TM logo — rather  I’d be looking for some traits of lower quality manufacturing techniques (such as the other ones we’ve pointed out).  [Comparison 2.](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/air-jordan-1-logo-how-to-spot-fake-2-copy-1024x1024.jpg)  Over here we can notice that the fake letters are not bold  like in the previous comparison — but they’re also not getting the right amount of weight.  It seems like the fake Jordan logo here has very thin letters — so thin that in some cases they’re not completely legible. Notice the fake A’s horizontal line. Or the highlighted line in the “D” letter that’s thin and inconsistent.  At the same time  the “J” character seems to be different — it’s not only the letter’s shape  but also the sizing. For some reason  the fake “J” is taller than the other letters.  Moving on to the ™ character  the fake example in this case is too thick  quite the contrast from the previously analysed replica. The cause of this flaw is visible to the naked eye: it’s bigger than it’s supposed to be.  However  the most glaring flaw here is that the “wings” elements are too close to each other. So close that they’re touching and sometimes even overlapping.  >*If there’s one thing you need to keep in mind when it comes to telling real vs fake Air Jordan 1 logos  it’s this: the original shoe must have a high level of precision and detail.*  That is **the only thing** you need to spot: whether there are any small details that are not precise enough  which would be there as a consequence of compromises in quality.  I’m not saying Nike is never putting out imperfections  it’s just that they’re never letting pairs with *so many* imperfections leave the assembly line.  [Comparison 3](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/air-jordan-1-logo-legit-check-guide-1024x1024.jpg)  This used to be a very common flaw in the past but it’s been majorly fixed. However  most of the time  fake manufacturers fix a flaw and create 2 other flaws.  I was not surprised to see this inconsistency come back as soon as some other big ones were fixed on top-quality replicas.  The R and D in “JORDAN” should always be connected. It’s ironic how top-level fakes have this flaw again  in some cases.  That aside  our go-to thing still applies in this real vs fake comparison above: the wings elements are printed in a poorer manner — fuzzy lines and overlapping areas can be noticed.  # 2. Tongue tag  Up next  we’ll analyse what we usually look after when starting a guide: an element that’s small (therefore needs high-precision manufacturing tools) and hardly visible to anyone but the wearer.  The reason for our thinking is simple: these elements are where the replica manufacturers will compromise. The tongue tag is no exception and in fact I’m surprised myself that we didn’t start the guide with this flaw.  The Air Jordan logo is not perfected even though it’s visible on the outside of the sneaker. But I digress. Let’s have a look at how to spot the fake Jordan 1 this way:  [Comparison tongue tag](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/tongue-tag-air-jordan-1-real-vs-fake-1024x1024.jpg)  There are quite a few things we can look out for but the broad statement is that you need to be aware of two things:  1. A thinner font is used on the fake Air Jordan 1 tag 2. As a consequence  the font is sometimes illegible  The highlighted points show some quick giveaways for the thinner font  but the most important one is the “CHINA” text comparison.  As you can see  the “A” is not entirely legible in the fake example  while the H letter is wider. Naturally  it’s not easy for you to remember these things  so we recommend either coming back to this legitcheck’s guide pictures or keeping an eye out for weakly-printed text.  What do I mean by weakly printed text? Look at the highlighted french “VOTRE” on the Jordan 1 tag. Can you notice how the “E” is not entirely printed?  Maybe a better example is the “E” in “GARANTIE”  the neighbour word. If we compare that to the authentic example  yes  they’re not printed with the utmost precision — but we can see the difference in quality.  Worth mentioning as well is that this is a high-quality replica  thus wavy text does not occur as often as we’ll see soon — but even so  you can notice how the “SWOOSH ®” text is not straight on the fake Jordan tag.  # 3. Nike Swoosh  Enough with the micro-analyses  at least for the moment. Let’s head back to the visible parts of the sneaker.  We’ll have a look at the real vs fake Nike swoosh comparison for the Air Jordan 1.  [Comparison](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/swoosh-air-jordan-1-legit-check-guide-1024x1024.jpg)  It seems like the fake Jordans sometimes come with a bulky end of the Nike swoosh  when it’s supposed to be pointy.  There’s not much to say here besides the fact that it’s an instant callout for a fake pair  should you spot anything like this. Even on top tier replicas (won't name them as my plan is not to promote them) this flaw is present every now and then.  As you might've noticed with fakes  whenever there's a new batch that fixes a flaw  another very-obvious-and-rookie flaw is popping up. Seems like this flaw would be one of those.  # 4.

Below the medial line  keep in mind that the sneaker has to have almost a bell-shaped bottom in order for it to be authentic.  Please note that this flaw is hard to spot when wearing the Jordans but it must be a dead giveaway for a fake.  Top-tier replicas sometimes get this thing right so it’s not the most reliable tell. Nonetheless  it might save you minutes when authenticating since the large majority of fakes are not from the top-tier category.  In other words  knowing this flaw will enable you to spot most of the fakes in a few seconds.  Let us finish this way of spotting fake Nike Air Jordan 1 [by dropping a second example  just to make everything clear.](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/hourglass-shape-air-jordan-1-fake-vs-real-1024x1024.jpg)  # Conclusion  Coming up next is a definitive complete L.C. guide for the...

1197,gimmmbal,[WDYWT] no camo needed,Hello fellow JORDANheadz  I'm hoping you'll be able to help me make this resource even better  should you know your stuff.  Please remember  **this guide is meant to be an all around for most Jordan 1 releases**  so whatever you recommend has to apply to most colourways (exception: stuff like Satin SBB or other special releases). Anything you see that can be improved  lmk in the comments.  Also worth noting: we analyze the best fakes first  then dive into alternative batches. If it looks like we haven't analysed the best replica  there's a reason why we explained some other flaw on another version of the fake.  I need to drop this link here so that Google won't penalize the LegitCheck App's blog  thinking it's a duplicate. I recommend having a look there as well since there are 11 tells but below I'll list the topmost 5: [https://chdaniel.com/legitcheckapp/guides/air-jordan/fake-vs-real-universal-guide/](https://chdaniel.com/legitcheckapp/guides/air-jordan/fake-vs-real-universal-guide/)  Also  check the footer of this post where I put together all the previous Reddit posts (though you can find them all in the app as well)  Without any further ado...  # 1. Air Jordan logo fake vs real  As you will see in the pictures below  fake manufacturers manage to replicate 90 to 98% of the logo right  but there are some shortcomings. [Comparison 1.](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/air-jordan-1-logo-real-vs-fake-1024x1024.jpg)  Broadly speaking we can point out two major things:  1. The authentic Jordan wings logo comes with thinner letters (except for the TM character) 2. At the same time  the overall quality of the print is lower on the fake.  We don’t want to leave it at this broad statement  so we’ll explain these two major flaws with the highlighted areas (highlighted with the hand emoji) and then we’re going to show some other comparisons.  Let’s start with the real vs fake Jordan logo comparison explanation from the left. The “A” character **is significantly thinner** on the authentic pair  but please **notice how the fake “A” outlines are also fuzzier.**  Up next  we want to point out how the “J” and “O” are not completely separate on the fake Air Jordan 1  whereas on the authentic AJ1 example there is definitely spacing between the two.  Ths same flaw can be noticed between “D” and “A” on the fake Air Jordan 1. If you’re wondering how to legitcheck Air Jordan 1’s  this is one of the fastest ways — look out for inconsistencies on the size tag  such as this one.  Coming up next  we’ve highlighted the “R” letter for the lack of precision on the fake example — once again  this is a compromise made by the fake manufacturers so that they can save money. This kind of flaw should never ever happen on an authentic pair.  And here’s one of the most important things on how to spot the fake Nike Air Jordan 1:  >*Pay attention to the spacing between these “wings” elements on the fake logo. Notice how there’s less space between elements on the authentic pair. On top of that  the fake elements are less defined (coming with fuzzier lines).*  Last but not least  it seems like the ™ character is too small on the replica Jordans and  as a consequence  thinner.  I wouldn’t base my authentication solely on the TM logo — rather  I’d be looking for some traits of lower quality manufacturing techniques (such as the other ones we’ve pointed out).  [Comparison 2.](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/air-jordan-1-logo-how-to-spot-fake-2-copy-1024x1024.jpg)  Over here we can notice that the fake letters are not bold  like in the previous comparison — but they’re also not getting the right amount of weight.  It seems like the fake Jordan logo here has very thin letters — so thin that in some cases they’re not completely legible. Notice the fake A’s horizontal line. Or the highlighted line in the “D” letter that’s thin and inconsistent.  At the same time  the “J” character seems to be different — it’s not only the letter’s shape  but also the sizing. For some reason  the fake “J” is taller than the other letters.  Moving on to the ™ character  the fake example in this case is too thick  quite the contrast from the previously analysed replica. The cause of this flaw is visible to the naked eye: it’s bigger than it’s supposed to be.  However  the most glaring flaw here is that the “wings” elements are too close to each other. So close that they’re touching and sometimes even overlapping.  >*If there’s one thing you need to keep in mind when it comes to telling real vs fake Air Jordan 1 logos  it’s this: the original shoe must have a high level of precision and detail.*  That is **the only thing** you need to spot: whether there are any small details that are not precise enough  which would be there as a consequence of compromises in quality.  I’m not saying Nike is never putting out imperfections  it’s just that they’re never letting pairs with *so many* imperfections leave the assembly line.  [Comparison 3](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/air-jordan-1-logo-legit-check-guide-1024x1024.jpg)  This used to be a very common flaw in the past but it’s been majorly fixed. However  most of the time  fake manufacturers fix a flaw and create 2 other flaws.  I was not surprised to see this inconsistency come back as soon as some other big ones were fixed on top-quality replicas.  The R and D in “JORDAN” should always be connected. It’s ironic how top-level fakes have this flaw again  in some cases.  That aside  our go-to thing still applies in this real vs fake comparison above: the wings elements are printed in a poorer manner — fuzzy lines and overlapping areas can be noticed.  # 2. Tongue tag  Up next  we’ll analyse what we usually look after when starting a guide: an element that’s small (therefore needs high-precision manufacturing tools) and hardly visible to anyone but the wearer.  The reason for our thinking is simple: these elements are where the replica manufacturers will compromise. The tongue tag is no exception and in fact I’m surprised myself that we didn’t start the guide with this flaw.  The Air Jordan logo is not perfected even though it’s visible on the outside of the sneaker. But I digress. Let’s have a look at how to spot the fake Jordan 1 this way:  [Comparison tongue tag](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/tongue-tag-air-jordan-1-real-vs-fake-1024x1024.jpg)  There are quite a few things we can look out for but the broad statement is that you need to be aware of two things:  1. A thinner font is used on the fake Air Jordan 1 tag 2. As a consequence  the font is sometimes illegible  The highlighted points show some quick giveaways for the thinner font  but the most important one is the “CHINA” text comparison.  As you can see  the “A” is not entirely legible in the fake example  while the H letter is wider. Naturally  it’s not easy for you to remember these things  so we recommend either coming back to this legitcheck’s guide pictures or keeping an eye out for weakly-printed text.  What do I mean by weakly printed text? Look at the highlighted french “VOTRE” on the Jordan 1 tag. Can you notice how the “E” is not entirely printed?  Maybe a better example is the “E” in “GARANTIE”  the neighbour word. If we compare that to the authentic example  yes  they’re not printed with the utmost precision — but we can see the difference in quality.  Worth mentioning as well is that this is a high-quality replica  thus wavy text does not occur as often as we’ll see soon — but even so  you can notice how the “SWOOSH ®” text is not straight on the fake Jordan tag.  # 3. Nike Swoosh  Enough with the micro-analyses  at least for the moment. Let’s head back to the visible parts of the sneaker.  We’ll have a look at the real vs fake Nike swoosh comparison for the Air Jordan 1.  [Comparison](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/swoosh-air-jordan-1-legit-check-guide-1024x1024.jpg)  It seems like the fake Jordans sometimes come with a bulky end of the Nike swoosh  when it’s supposed to be pointy.  There’s not much to say here besides the fact that it’s an instant callout for a fake pair  should you spot anything like this. Even on top tier replicas (won't name them as my plan is not to promote them) this flaw is present every now and then.  As you might've noticed with fakes  whenever there's a new batch that fixes a flaw  another very-obvious-and-rookie flaw is popping up. Seems like this flaw would be one of those.  # 4. Bulkiness of the shoe  Something replica creators seem to not get right is the overall shape of the sneaker  making it too bulky. Let’s have a look at this real vs fake Jordan 1 shape comparison below:  [Comparison](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/shape-air-jordan-1-fake-vs-real-guide-1024x1024.jpg)  The authentic example’s curvature (highlighted on the upper right side) is not something that you will find on every single original pair  so don’t take that as the go-to way every time.  However  most pairs have that kind of curvature  since they’re made using Nike’s higher-quality moulds.  But let’s leave that aside for a second. The bulkiness of the toe box is a more reliable factor. This is a flaw that is easy to spot when you have both the real and the fake pair next to each other — which 99.999% percent won’t have.  What you can remember though is the fact that  from the profile view  the toe box doesn’t have to come with a straight ascending line.  On the authentic pair  it seems like the toe box curves a tiny bit. As a consequence  highlighted in the lower left corner  the sneaker’s sole sits higher.  When we’re authenticating these sneakers  what we keep in mind is that the sole mustn’t be fantastically flat — and that’s all you need to know when it comes to auth.  checking the sole of the Air Jordan 1.  We’ve attached a second comparison of the AJ1 bulkier construction on the fakes so we can highlight the difference one more time:  [Comparison](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/shape-air-jordan-1-real-vs-fake-1024x1024.jpg)  # 5. Hourglass shape  Speaking of the shoe’s construction  we need to have a look from the rear for this following flaw on the fakes. This is a flaw that indeed is almost fixed on top-tier fakes  but most replicas are not those. Therefore  that  combined with how much time it would save if one knows this makes this flaw worthy of being higher in our top of flaws to look after.  It’s been commonly nicknamed as the “hourglass shape” tell and it’s easier for us to explain it visually with a comparison.  [Comparison](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/hourglass-shape-air-jordan-1-legit-check-guide-1024x1024.jpg)  And now the comparison with [drawn lines on top of the pics to make you understand better](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/hourglass-shape-air-jordan-1-real-vs-fake-1024x1024.jpg).

Please remember  **this guide is meant to be an all around for most Jordan 1 releases**  so whatever you recommend has to apply to most colourways (exception: stuff like Satin SBB or other special releases). Anything you see that can be improved  lmk in the comments.  Also worth noting: we analyze the best fakes first  then dive into alternative batches. If it looks like we haven't analysed the best replica  there's a reason why we explained some other flaw on another version of the fake.  I need to drop this link here so that Google won't penalize the LegitCheck App's blog  thinking it's a duplicate. I recommend having a look there as well since there are 11 tells but below I'll list the topmost 5: [https://chdaniel.com/legitcheckapp/guides/air-jordan/fake-vs-real-universal-guide/](https://chdaniel.com/legitcheckapp/guides/air-jordan/fake-vs-real-universal-guide/)  Also  check the footer of this post where I put together all the previous Reddit posts (though you can find them all in the app as well)  Without any further ado...  # 1. Air Jordan logo fake vs real  As you will see in the pictures below  fake manufacturers manage to replicate 90 to 98% of the logo right  but there are some shortcomings. [Comparison 1.](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/air-jordan-1-logo-real-vs-fake-1024x1024.jpg)  Broadly speaking we can point out two major things:  1. The authentic Jordan wings logo comes with thinner letters (except for the TM character) 2. At the same time  the overall quality of the print is lower on the fake.  We don’t want to leave it at this broad statement  so we’ll explain these two major flaws with the highlighted areas (highlighted with the hand emoji) and then we’re going to show some other comparisons.  Let’s start with the real vs fake Jordan logo comparison explanation from the left. The “A” character **is significantly thinner** on the authentic pair  but please **notice how the fake “A” outlines are also fuzzier.**  Up next  we want to point out how the “J” and “O” are not completely separate on the fake Air Jordan 1  whereas on the authentic AJ1 example there is definitely spacing between the two.  Ths same flaw can be noticed between “D” and “A” on the fake Air Jordan 1. If you’re wondering how to legitcheck Air Jordan 1’s  this is one of the fastest ways — look out for inconsistencies on the size tag  such as this one.  Coming up next  we’ve highlighted the “R” letter for the lack of precision on the fake example — once again  this is a compromise made by the fake manufacturers so that they can save money. This kind of flaw should never ever happen on an authentic pair.  And here’s one of the most important things on how to spot the fake Nike Air Jordan 1:  >*Pay attention to the spacing between these “wings” elements on the fake logo. Notice how there’s less space between elements on the authentic pair. On top of that  the fake elements are less defined (coming with fuzzier lines).*  Last but not least  it seems like the ™ character is too small on the replica Jordans and  as a consequence  thinner.  I wouldn’t base my authentication solely on the TM logo — rather  I’d be looking for some traits of lower quality manufacturing techniques (such as the other ones we’ve pointed out).  [Comparison 2.](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/air-jordan-1-logo-how-to-spot-fake-2-copy-1024x1024.jpg)  Over here we can notice that the fake letters are not bold  like in the previous comparison — but they’re also not getting the right amount of weight.  It seems like the fake Jordan logo here has very thin letters — so thin that in some cases they’re not completely legible. Notice the fake A’s horizontal line. Or the highlighted line in the “D” letter that’s thin and inconsistent.  At the same time  the “J” character seems to be different — it’s not only the letter’s shape  but also the sizing. For some reason  the fake “J” is taller than the other letters.  Moving on to the ™ character  the fake example in this case is too thick  quite the contrast from the previously analysed replica. The cause of this flaw is visible to the naked eye: it’s bigger than it’s supposed to be.  However  the most glaring flaw here is that the “wings” elements are too close to each other. So close that they’re touching and sometimes even overlapping.  >*If there’s one thing you need to keep in mind when it comes to telling real vs fake Air Jordan 1 logos  it’s this: the original shoe must have a high level of precision and detail.*  That is **the only thing** you need to spot: whether there are any small details that are not precise enough  which would be there as a consequence of compromises in quality.  I’m not saying Nike is never putting out imperfections  it’s just that they’re never letting pairs with *so many* imperfections leave the assembly line.  [Comparison 3](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/air-jordan-1-logo-legit-check-guide-1024x1024.jpg)  This used to be a very common flaw in the past but it’s been majorly fixed. However  most of the time  fake manufacturers fix a flaw and create 2 other flaws.  I was not surprised to see this inconsistency come back as soon as some other big ones were fixed on top-quality replicas.  The R and D in “JORDAN” should always be connected. It’s ironic how top-level fakes have this flaw again  in some cases.  That aside  our go-to thing still applies in this real vs fake comparison above: the wings elements are printed in a poorer manner — fuzzy lines and overlapping areas can be noticed.  # 2. Tongue tag  Up next  we’ll analyse what we usually look after when starting a guide: an element that’s small (therefore needs high-precision manufacturing tools) and hardly visible to anyone but the wearer.  The reason for our thinking is simple: these elements are where the replica manufacturers will compromise. The tongue tag is no exception and in fact I’m surprised myself that we didn’t start the guide with this flaw.  The Air Jordan logo is not perfected even though it’s visible on the outside of the sneaker. But I digress. Let’s have a look at how to spot the fake Jordan 1 this way:  [Comparison tongue tag](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/tongue-tag-air-jordan-1-real-vs-fake-1024x1024.jpg)  There are quite a few things we can look out for but the broad statement is that you need to be aware of two things:  1. A thinner font is used on the fake Air Jordan 1 tag 2. As a consequence  the font is sometimes illegible  The highlighted points show some quick giveaways for the thinner font  but the most important one is the “CHINA” text comparison.  As you can see  the “A” is not entirely legible in the fake example  while the H letter is wider. Naturally  it’s not easy for you to remember these things  so we recommend either coming back to this legitcheck’s guide pictures or keeping an eye out for weakly-printed text.  What do I mean by weakly printed text? Look at the highlighted french “VOTRE” on the Jordan 1 tag. Can you notice how the “E” is not entirely printed?  Maybe a better example is the “E” in “GARANTIE”  the neighbour word. If we compare that to the authentic example  yes  they’re not printed with the utmost precision — but we can see the difference in quality.  Worth mentioning as well is that this is a high-quality replica  thus wavy text does not occur as often as we’ll see soon — but even so  you can notice how the “SWOOSH ®” text is not straight on the fake Jordan tag.  # 3. Nike Swoosh  Enough with the micro-analyses  at least for the moment. Let’s head back to the visible parts of the sneaker.  We’ll have a look at the real vs fake Nike swoosh comparison for the Air Jordan 1.  [Comparison](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/swoosh-air-jordan-1-legit-check-guide-1024x1024.jpg)  It seems like the fake Jordans sometimes come with a bulky end of the Nike swoosh  when it’s supposed to be pointy.  There’s not much to say here besides the fact that it’s an instant callout for a fake pair  should you spot anything like this. Even on top tier replicas (won't name them as my plan is not to promote them) this flaw is present every now and then.  As you might've noticed with fakes  whenever there's a new batch that fixes a flaw  another very-obvious-and-rookie flaw is popping up. Seems like this flaw would be one of those.  # 4. Bulkiness of the shoe  Something replica creators seem to not get right is the overall shape of the sneaker  making it too bulky. Let’s have a look at this real vs fake Jordan 1 shape comparison below:  [Comparison](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/shape-air-jordan-1-fake-vs-real-guide-1024x1024.jpg)  The authentic example’s curvature (highlighted on the upper right side) is not something that you will find on every single original pair  so don’t take that as the go-to way every time.  However  most pairs have that kind of curvature  since they’re made using Nike’s higher-quality moulds.  But let’s leave that aside for a second. The bulkiness of the toe box is a more reliable factor. This is a flaw that is easy to spot when you have both the real and the fake pair next to each other — which 99.999% percent won’t have.  What you can remember though is the fact that  from the profile view  the toe box doesn’t have to come with a straight ascending line.  On the authentic pair  it seems like the toe box curves a tiny bit. As a consequence  highlighted in the lower left corner  the sneaker’s sole sits higher.  When we’re authenticating these sneakers  what we keep in mind is that the sole mustn’t be fantastically flat — and that’s all you need to know when it comes to auth.  checking the sole of the Air Jordan 1.  We’ve attached a second comparison of the AJ1 bulkier construction on the fakes so we can highlight the difference one more time:  [Comparison](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/shape-air-jordan-1-real-vs-fake-1024x1024.jpg)  # 5. Hourglass shape  Speaking of the shoe’s construction  we need to have a look from the rear for this following flaw on the fakes. This is a flaw that indeed is almost fixed on top-tier fakes  but most replicas are not those. Therefore  that  combined with how much time it would save if one knows this makes this flaw worthy of being higher in our top of flaws to look after.  It’s been commonly nicknamed as the “hourglass shape” tell and it’s easier for us to explain it visually with a comparison.  [Comparison](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/hourglass-shape-air-jordan-1-legit-check-guide-1024x1024.jpg)  And now the comparison with [drawn lines on top of the pics to make you understand better](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/hourglass-shape-air-jordan-1-real-vs-fake-1024x1024.jpg).  As you can see  the fake Air Jordan 1 is almost straight when it comes to this angle’s view. On the other hand  the original AJ1 is curving in two places: above and below the medial line.  Below the medial line  keep in mind that the sneaker has to have almost a bell-shaped bottom in order for it to be authentic.  Please note that this flaw is hard to spot when wearing the Jordans but it must be a dead giveaway for a fake.  Top-tier replicas sometimes get this thing right so it’s not the most reliable tell. Nonetheless  it might save you minutes when authenticating since the large majority of fakes are not from the top-tier category.  In other words  knowing this flaw will enable you to spot most of the fakes in a few seconds.  Let us finish this way of spotting fake Nike Air Jordan 1 [by dropping a second example  just to make everything clear.](https://chdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/hourglass-shape-air-jordan-1-fake-vs-real-1024x1024.jpg)  # Conclusion  Coming up next is a definitive complete L.C. guide for the...
