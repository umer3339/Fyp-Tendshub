No blowouts but they've seen some love 5. Blank Label Custom Selvedge Chinos    1. Got these from a custom clothing brand - they're selvedge chinos but they sewed over the selvedge line -\_-. The inseam on these is kinda short  they were meant to be more summery chinos. Great pants  but I mostly wear my outlier pants now  and weirdly enough these never fit me that well  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  |Name|Size|Asking Price|Imgur Album|Desctiption Link|Waist Measurement|Front Rise|Back Rise|Thigh|Opening| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |H.W.

While in college  it did not really matter all that much on dressing up and  if I did  it was more of a slacks and polo/dress shirt ordeal.  To make matters worse  I'm considered a bigger guy (6'0"" and around 340lb). This makes it an absolute pain to find any decent clothes  and I'm usually stuck between looking decent and clothes not fitting properly  or clothes fitting great but they are bland. The place I'm working at has a pretty casual dress code policy (jeans and a nice shirt  could be button up or regular).

They're a small company based in Mexico and they've had some quality control issues in the past  but the pair I got was of good quality (not as good as Allen Edmonds  but better than Cole Haan or the department store brands) and I would've kept it if it had fit me well. John Doe Shoes also has a buy 3x2 deal where if you buy three items you get one free so that's another plus for getting nice shoes at a good price. You can go to r/goodyearwelt for more details. PM me if you want to see pictures of the JDS shoes I got.

From The Verge:  Crucially (and perhaps surprisingly)  none of the striking workers have called on shoppers to boycott Prime Day sales. There’s no official guidance on how shoppers should support the strike  and many of the striking workers who talked to The Verge were ambivalent on the question. In some sense  it’s beside the point. The strike is meant to show that the success of Prime Day depends on warehouse workers — but that message is more about fulfillment queues than sales numbers. Solidarity is always welcome in a strike  but it’s hard to draw a clear  straight line from the workers’ demands to the Buy button.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.34621212121212125,3696,

That’s a manipulative practice which should be banned.  But the 60 hour work week is literally part of the job—it’s not hidden or anything  and you get paid overtime for the 20 extra hours according to your own link. They also give exceptions for overtime  so it doesn’t even seem that mandatory.  The physical labor issue is just that—it’s a physical job  do you expect not having to work on your feet? It’s like a construction worker complaining about physical work. Especially considering that warehouse workers don’t need educational qualifications  the only reason they’d get paid this much instead of minimum wage *is* the labor requirement.

The 99% cotton jeans are pretty nice. However  I just got a black pair of 512’s on Amazon which I think is like only 95% cotton and they feel much thinner  almost like slacks.  Compared against a pair I got directly from Levi’s  the 99% cotton all black is thicker and feels more like real jeans.  I don’t think this is an Amazon thing with the thickness either. I got a pair of “Avenger” 512’s (again  99% cotton) on Amazon in the same order and they feel awesome. They’re actually my favorite pair of jeans now. Avenger is like black  but powdered with gray.

The thing with Harley is that they've made HUGE improvements that even sport bike riders and younger riders would appreciate.  They've pretty much pissed off their old customer base by ditching the Dyna.  But the replacement bike  the Softails running the Milwaukee 8 motor  are significantly improved.  Way better suspension  way smoother engine  better handling than before.  As long as the motor holds up to the abuse  Harley has a fucking killer bike on their hands.    But the old timers are angry that the Dyna is gone.  Traditionalists  where Harley is  for once  trying to get with the times  and are doing a good job of it.  So they're trying to appeal to a younger crowd now.  And with the young crowd chopper scene doing really well  it's a smart move on their part.

I dont remember how much my insurance was back in my college age era.  I just remember I was paying $400 a month for my truck  plus over $100 insurance  plus gas.  Then I bought a 2008 harley for $10k brand new and rode it so much I ended up selling the truck and just riding the harley for like 2 years.  Bike payment was $150  insurance less than $100  and gas was like $5-$7 a tank.    I've had about 6 different bikes  2 of them harleys  and out of all of them I always felt the most comfortable and ""at home"" on the harley.  I agree most people aren't considering them when shopping  but damn near everyone I talk to that rides a metric cruiser tells me theyd like to have a harley too.  I always equated it to when I tell people I'm ex-military  there's always the inevitable ""yeah I was gonna join  but..."".  ""I was gonna get a harley  but..."".   I dont get hung up on what people ride  my tattoo doesnt say ""harley""  it says ""forever two wheels""  but harley will probably be my main bike from here on out.  I think if you're really serious about riding  you should consider a Harley  especially the new M8's.  If you just want a bike to satisfy some temporary spark  sure  drop 3 grand on a throwaway metric.  I've had 3 of them  they're awesome.  I think it all boils down to what you want as a biker.  But IMO Harley is actually putting effort into shedding that stigma of ""overpriced  overrated"".  Up until this 2019 streetbob  the ""best"" bike I'd ridden was the Kawasaki Vulcan Classic 1600.  But now this Streetbob has made me feel like I just discovered motorcycles again.",,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.22047750229568416,4458,

Theres a pretty good chopper scene going right now  big groups of young riders building custom choppers and bobbers for cheap.  Harley is all over it  marketing-wise.  Selling 70s style 3/4 metalflake helmets in their stores  their posters featuring chuck tailors and denim vests.  Check out the Lowbrow Custom/Biltwell chopper stuff on YouTube and tell me Harley isn't try to attract those guys lol.  The new bikes and style are straight out of a lowbrow customs group ride video.  It's almost like Harley is trying to match the current bike scene rather than pander to the R.U.B's.

I was hyped from this post so I got a pair. Here's my review. I got medium (5'6 145lb  no chest measurement sorry) it Came wrinkly out the bag  definite loose/wrinkly neckline in the future  armhole section flares out for me  would like to think it's my lats growing but the hem looks off on mine  material feels good not great  looks like a slim fit minimal basketball Jersey.        7/10 product  would recommend because the tank in white hides my pointy nipples  wish I got black tho. I like it but I'm not super happy with it. Get TTS if you wear it as undergarment  1sizeupMario if you wanna flex in public. I'm satisfied  I guess. Looks great tucked in  but I really dislike how the bottom half of the armhole flares out on mine. Maybe its because I sized up and its wrinkly idk.        10/10 Airism product for me is the beige V-neck one size up. I am a dark-skinned-ish 23 y/o asian man that looks 17 and it complements my skin very well. But that's what my mom and sister said so idk. Feels good on skin  feels good on mood.

I went on a pretty crazy deep dive  even buying the men's and women's versions of some models  doing a dare-to-compare  and some models are actually exactly the same (given the size conversion of Men's being 1.5 sizes down from Women's).  But model to model and year by year  it changes. For example  Zoom Fly SP was marketed as a Unisex shoe. But the Zoom Fly 3  Nike explicitly stated that men's and women's will be slightly different.

He resorted to deleting legitimate posts about shilling all while defending the corporation. It's not their community  it's not their test market. All he did in post thread was establish what good he had done on this sub while ignoring user's woes. He has brought up family several times like this sub was giving him a headache and that's a terrible mindset. Dude  if it affects your family life  leave the moderation team. It's a volunteer job. Don't let this shit break you. The sub was alive before you and will be alive after you.        - You personally disregarded all complaints in announcement thread by comparing the participants in complaints vs. the number of subscribers. 1.3 million aren't active in this sub. 1.3 million aren't going to voice their opinion here.    - I understand lululemon have high prices but it's because they do tons of marketing. Rhone's prices are similar  quality can't be that much better (they aren't using expensive materials) and yet spend zero in regular marketing (thousands in shady marketing). What's next? AMA from Daniel Wellington and MVMT?     - If you're gonna start  start with basic brands that are well trusted in this community like JCrew  Uniqlo  Taft  Allen Edmonds  etc. JCrew for Killshots obviously.

Or trying to make the sub appeal to new members or something?? /u/fortitude21 said [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/car9pt/ama_we_are_the_team_at_rhone_ask_us_anything/etgqbfh/)  *""there has been an interest in expanding the community and user experience""*.  I personally think that's not the right approach to take. This sub is already 1.3M users large. It wasn't until March 2018 that the actual NBA subreddit hit 1M subscribers (note: it has since more than doubled now to 2.5M subscribers). But that's an actual sports sub.  We don't need rapid growth here. By the very nature of this sub  there are a finite number of deals out there. We're not talking about standard ""sale"" items of a retailer here  we're talking steeper than that. I don't want to sound exclusive  but frankly the larger this sub grows  the fewer deals there are. If it's by organic growth  by all means  I can't complain. But if there's some marketing push to get subscriber count up to 2M and that means we lose out on deals  I'm not a huge fan of that.  # An Experiment  That's what this was and it failed. My feedback here is to learn from it. The users here aren't looking for a special community experience  to be honest. We're here looking for deals and to discuss deals and what the best items from a sale are. We don't need some special unique experience  if I'm honest. My view don't represent everyone  but that's what it seems like.  The only AMA I'd actually be interested in is something related to deals. Maybe J Crew's person in charge of deals doing an AMA. *That* would actually captivate the community here. The sub was so engaged with The Flashening. Wouldn't it be cool to hear from someone involved with the company? I think that'd be cool as hell.  But honestly  I don't care about this brand that I've never seen posted in this sub. It's a boutique brand that sells expensive items. Whether it's worth the price isn't the discussion for this sub. This sub is focused on deals and frugality. Doesn't matter if they were raffling off $25 gift cards. It doesn't fit the tone of the sub and the mods should hae seen that.  # Mod Response  This one is a big one. I'm personally of the opinion that /u/frankum1 should step down. His response has been very unbecoming and doesn't sit with me well at all. And I don't say this lightly either. Hell  a mod in the Lakers sub got bamboozled last week and while everyone was calling for them to step down  I didn't agree with it. But this time I agree with the others.  Why? Look at the way /u/frankum1 types and has responded.  > I think I've responded to enough people in here that if you can't see that we tried to make this a good and positive thing for FMF  then I don't know what else to do.  > **We tried to do a good thing for you and it failed.**  Source: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/cbp4n6/rhone_ama_discussion/ethe2l5/)  Holy moly does that last sentence rub me the wrong way. That's now owning up for an experiment gone south  that's borderline shaming **US** for not agreeing with the AMA. Or to garner sympathy for the AMA's failure. It's like a ""we tried to do a good thing for you  sorry you didn't know how to appreciate it"". Or I don't even know  but it really bothers me.  Then the posts that he makes in response to the thread:  > but baseless accusations collapsed it.  > Thank you for your response.  > Relax man  we did our best.  > Thank you for your opinion!  > Thanks for responding.  Source: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/cbp4n6/rhone_ama_discussion/etj5p0x/)  All of this screams passive aggressiveness. Doesn't seem like a mod figure trying to own up for a failure. The ""thanks for your opinion!"" gets me. It pretty much translates to  ""hey shut the fuck up! :D"" in my eyes when coming from a mod.  > Nope  I entirely get it. AMA's not allowed here.  Source: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/cbp4n6/rhone_ama_discussion/etjjufg/)  That sounds straight up salty.   > Feel free to read my 70+ comments to invalidate your claim.  > 70+ comments. Fully engaging.  > I’ve explained this many times already.  > Thank you for sharing your opinion.  > Thank you for your response.  > I appreciate you sharing your thoughts.  See the responses above don't actually mean anything. ""Thank you for sharing your opinion. Thank you for your thoughts. Thank you for posting"". None of that actually means  ""we'll take your feedback into consideration.""  It's literally  ""thanks for typing words"".  **The kickers:**  > We wanted to try the AMA  **the accusations destroyed it**. We won't try it again.  (Basically the AMA failed because it was our fault)  > **We hope everyone has time to cool down and take a better  more well-thought out response to what we've done.**  (Basically we need to take a time out and cool off so we can better appreciate what he's done for us)  This shit failed. We can appreciate the work that mods do for the sub  but this failed straight up. No need to defend it. No need to paint yourselves in a  ""we work so hard to improve the community but get no appreciation/no one likes it/people cause it to fail"".

Frankly I have no issues with an AMA even though it seems to be in the wrong sub. But u/frankum1’s persistent defending despite obvious photoshopping is highly suspicious. I wouldn’t know how u mods deliberate the issue and the power balance amongst each other when it comes to an argument  but it would seem that u/frankum1 had the most to gain from forcing the AMA to proceed. One definitely wonders if Rhone privately contacted him outside of the mod mail with enticements.   From his previous posts it would seem he is the person behind all these new changes to FMF. And judging by the way he replied over the past few days  he is stubborn to the point of wearing his opponents down  and will not concede mistakes or bad ideas on his part openly. You can peruse that thread and see that there is barely anybody who agrees with him. Most people including myself are more aggrieved by his responses and crisis management than the AMA or shill accounts or photoshopping itself. And despite being told multiple times over and over again  he is just telling people very politely to fuck off. Noted. Feedback received. Okay. Whatever. I don’t care. He can’t seem to say sorry  and that is a sign of a very toxic masculinity mindset ( LOL I had to mention masculinity here ) and he shouldn’t be a mod if he is very inclined on heavy touch moderation-my way or the high way. We don’t OWE him anything. Maybe rhone does or did.   The logical emotional response is to feel betrayed that Rhone took advantage of your naïveté by catching the mod team pants down and pushing their marketing through. That’s being green and is forgiveable  However looking at his unflinchingly loyal intransigence and it makes you wonder if he is more than just power hungry or even bribed as some folks have speculated.   If the mod team is to regain some credibility  there is no need for political correctness since u/frankum1 has already set himself up as the big bad  or maybe the treasonous one  selling out the sub for possible personal gain? He should fall on his own sword  gold plated now as it should be. Surely you folks could free him from his onerous duties as a mod to join the Rhone customer service department with better pay and more family time as he so pitifully whined in the other thread. This will definitely quell the anger. Since it’s mostly comes from horrendous moderation.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.08441963494595074,5223,

Thanks  Fortitude.  Personally  I don't think trying an AMA once was a bad idea per se. I don't even think trying it with a brand *like* Rhone was a bad idea per se. If there had been normal questions and answers it probably would've went okay-ish. I do think the first clue that it might not turn out well was the reception it got in the AMA announcement thread  but still  without the bad/weird questions and answers it wouldn't have spiralled into the disaster it became.  There was probably no way the mods could've known beforehand  but it turns out the way Rhone handled everything was pretty terrible  so in retrospect they were about the absolutely worst company to try your first AMA out with. I'm going to list those here for clarification and to put it all in one place:  &#x200B;  \-They photoshopped an image to promote the AMA.  &#x200B;  \-When confronted with photoshopping an image  they claimed it was an 'innocent mistake' and wasn't 'disingenuous'. They should have immediately taken full responsibility for it such as 'that was a bad mistake. we shouldn't have done that and realise how it's deceptive. we're sorry.' Obviously for at least one member of the company it was purposely deceptive  the one(s) who made it  and maybe also any of the ones who had the idea to do it  the ones who knew about it and the ones who approved/ordered it. Instead the two leaders of the company doing the AMA tried to act like they had no idea and couldn't be blamed or take responsibility for what others in the company did  which was a terrible response.  &#x200B;  \-It is still sort of an open question to some whether the new accounts were shills or people coming from Rhone's social media announcements  perhaps maybe a few odd super-fans that companies sometime have and/or people trying to win the $25 gift cards. While I won't come down firmly on one side or the other  I will list the suspiciousness of the accounts.  **(1)** They were all new accounts. None of them happened to have reddit accounts before.  **(2)** They all seemed to open their accounts around the same time.  **(3)** From some intrepid users' investigations  it seems none of the usernames have any history in internet searches. This is an important one  as many people use the same/similar usernames or at least some variation of user names when signing up for new sites. Sure  some people may choose brand new names when signing up for a new site  but when you look at all the new accounts as a group  it would be very odd for every single one to decide to choose a brand new name when signing up for reddit for an AMA with a brand they really like and likely would've interacted with on other social media. In fact  the assumption would almost go in the other direction  that they'd be more likely to use a similar name for reddit to better be recognised from the other social media.  **(4)** These brand new accounts asked questions that were complementary  excited  leading and  most importantly  oddly worded and similarly worded. If you read them and these accounts' other reply posts to Rhone  enough use words like 'gear' (do a search on the AMA page for 'gear' and see) for their clothes and other buzzwords  many often mention specific Rhone clothing pieces by full capitalised name  two questions in a row (you can sort by old and do word search for 'closet' to see) both say that Rhone is 'taking over my closet'  and there is a certain unnaturalness about the variety of (the few) questions asked that some might say were as if meant to cover a specific set of bullet point topics to discuss.  (5) As noted by Fortitude above  the new users also had suspicious editing history at similar times.  &#x200B;  \-Rhone's replies to the questions seemed odd  some might say they sounded pre-written  canned  pat  self-serving  aggrandising  thought out in advance. Regardless  they definitely did NOT sound off the cuff and natural  which is supposed to be the point of doing an AMA. Though it's not being discussed nearly as much as other issues regarding the AMA  this was probably THE single biggest red flag that the AMA was turning into a disaster. If their answers had only sounded real and natural  it would've given more weight to the defense that all the new accounts asking questions were just excited superfans from other social media  and perhaps the AMA might not've turned into such a disaster. But as it happened  the opposite occurred. Their unnatural replies only made the accounts asking questions even more suspicious. There are no pre-written answers without pre-written questions.  &#x200B;  \-Rhone offered five 'prizes' of $25 gift cards to the top five questions. This obviously originally meant the top five highest-voted questions. After the AMA they changed it to their top five favourite questions winning the gift cards. Even supposing for a minute that Rhone was mostly innocent of the other things  that was a bad  bad call. Supposing the new accounts were just excited superfans and not shills  I understand Rhone not really wanting to give out gift cards to the actual five highest voted questions  since the questions were negative and accusatory. However  changing the rules post-contest only hurts their already tanked credibility even more. If the new accounts were shills  it means they'll just be giving the gift cards back to themselves really. Even if the new accounts were just superfans  none were members of the sub or even redditors other than just for that one AMA  so none of the prizes would be going to anyone here in the actual sub. As painful as it might've been to them  they should've just gone through with the original rules and given it to the top five questions. But they changed the rules afterwards  and it just added to the disaster of the AMA.  &#x200B;  \-Most damningly  there is something that hasn't got much attention here  because it's not part of the AMA but oh  very related. u/joodle noted yesterday that there was an [article on Rhone and Reddit](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.glossy.co/fashion/how-fashion-brands-are-tapping-into-the-exclusive-reddit-community/amp) earlier this year. Despite claiming here at reddit that they're unfamiliar with it  in the article from months ago Rhone say in interview:  >""Reddit is one of the largest social networks on the internet ... \[Reddit is\] a big part of \[Rhone's\] strategy going forward""  They don't stop there! They also say (bolding mine):  >“**There are huge opportunities for** both **paid advertising on Reddit** and \[marketing\] through influencers ... There could be huge influencers on Reddit soon. **The mods may say it won’t happen but it could happen**”  I would like to know what u/6t5g u/sklark23 u/Fortitude21 u/frankum1 all think of those quotes from Rhone in connection with how Rhone presented themselves here and to the mods.",,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.05615806684355072,5226,

First  feedback from the community was not prompted. There was no post asking the community how it felt about company sponsored AMAs.  Second  out of no where  r/FMF received an announcement post of an AMA. So  the AMA was probably discussed amongst the mod team but there was no transparency or forum for feedback prior to this post on how the community felt about AMAs. Nor was there any conversation on the mods incentive to drive growth. Even though organic growth is occurring quite rapidly.  Third  while the announcement post was active  feedback was provided. There was clear negativity surrounding the idea and there was obvious and valid criticisms. This feedback was dismissed as being misrepresentative of the community as a whole because there was only 85 comments. Which means  the community feedback on the post did not outweigh the mod's vision for the future of the sub.  **With all that in mind  how can you say that the feedback of the community will help guide the subreddit???**  When the events that occurred demonstrated the complete opposite.

As often is the case with these things  the cover up was worse than the crime.  Mistakes were made along the way  but by far the most egregious one was the mod team's response - especially  but not limited to  /u/frankum1's behavior.  The first error was one of philosophy.  To echo others  this sub doesn't need mods to do things to actively grow the community.  You've got over a million subscribers and people who post regularly.  That's a healthy community.  Don't fix what isn't broken.  This community needs mods to help sustain it more than anything.  People to remove spam and toxic comments  and to make it easier for people to find the deals they're interested in.  Someone else suggested it  but things like flair relevant to specific types of items or deals (e.g. shoes  jackets  BOGO  Discount Code  etc.).  That's the only type of ""user experience enhancement"" that this sub needs.  Frankly  I think you need to look at how other deal subs run things.  It seemed like the intent was to start building this sub as a ""brand"" that would ""collaborate"" with clothing companies to get the community ""deals"" similar to Massdrop.  I could be completely wrong  but that was my first impression.  I think it should be clear now that the community does not want anything like that.  The second error was not listening to your community.  It was clear in the announcement that the community was against it  but you chose to write off their remarks as ""not representative"" for some reason.  What seems obvious to me is that those who care enough to comment are probably the most dedicated users.  Their voices matter the most because they are quite literally the only ones saying anything.  In hindsight this seems to be the first in a long string of instances where the mods disregarded the expressed desires of the community  and displayed a generally condescending attitude toward users.  The third error was how you handled the situation.  It seemed to me that /u/frankum1 was doing everything in his power to suppress criticism and obfuscate what was happening.  That was a huge error because it fed into the impression that at least some of the mods must be getting a kickback.  Even if that's not true  it created a situation where it looked more plausible than it should have.  I also noted how intentional mods were with how they phrased things.  You repeatedly said there's no evidence that the company created accounts.  Well  that's only one variation of the same similar charge.  Many others were complaining about the softball questions that the company was receiving from the new accounts.  While it is completely legitimate for people from other platforms to come to the site because of a genuine interest in an AMA  it doesn't seem legitimate for the AMA guests to solicit softball questions from their fanbase.  That feels a lot like brigading  which is a violation of Reddit ToS.  To my knowledge  this has not been addressed at all by mods.  You side step it by lumping that complaint with the ""they made sock puppet accounts"" charge.  This seems mighty convenient since it is almost impossible to prove if the company made accounts themselves or not while it has been proven that the company did solicit its fans to give them softball questions.  Since you're capable of being very intentional with your phrasing  per this post  it seems reasonable to assume lumping these two things together was also intentional.  Finally the ""we were just trying to do a good thing  sorry you didn't like this good thing we provided you"" attitude is extremely off-putting.  You still haven't dropped it and that is unfortunate.  I also don't buy the whole ""we have a real life  and jobs  so sorry"" excuse.  If being a mod is such a burden  why are you taking on more responsibilities by hosting AMAs  and actively trying to grow the community?  Seems counter intuitive.  Rather I think that it is part of a mod's standard techniques for deflecting blame for failing as a mod.  Unfortunately  for you guys given the circumstances this excuse doesn't hold water in this instance.  Overall  I think the higher ranked mods abdicated too many of their duties to someone  /u/frankum1  who is not temperamentally fit to be a mod  and whose vision doesn't align with the community.  He has too much influence on you and is steering this sub in the wrong direction.  Even if this was genuinely a controversy over nothing  how do you think he will react when there is a true controversy?  I'd guess not well given what just transpired.  I'd like to see him resign or be removed as mod.",,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.09504511552704327,5232,

I'll weigh in here mostly just bc I did in the last thread.   I think the bigger concern was how the immediate actions to the problem reflected on the moderation of the sub. It's understandable to want to try something new with the sub (though  as others mentioned  probably not necessary for this one). But the responses in the last thread don't indicate that there was an openness to EVALUATING it properly.   Even before the accusations  I would argue the AMA was not a real success and more appropriately reflected closer to the AMN that was suggested in the announcement thread.   Then the real issue was the subsequent locking/deleting/defending/gaslighting/etc and not really understanding the community's very vocal feedback at all  which I would think is the definition of the purpose of the mods.

Crew end-of-season sale  but you  gotta admit there's a whole lot of deals here that would fit into smaller categories.

I don't care either way if brands continue to do AMA's here  but yeah MFA is probably better  unless they have a FMF component. There's nothing wrong with growing this subreddit  and the mod's have said their goal is to hopefully bring brands here to offer further deals. While the sub has obviously grown a lot without reaching out to brands/AMA's etc... that doesn't mean there's anything wrong with moving towards that in the future.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",-0.0010416666666666632,5248,

Let’s say it was purely an altruistic desire to improve the subreddit. On the surface  that sounds commendable  even visionary.  But is it the moderation team’s job to be visionary? Or is it their job to administer the subreddit and keep it running smoothly?  I would suggest that the mod in question find another avenue for his visionary energy and ambition. Maybe he should start his own subreddit devoted to fashion company AMAs  which would give him full scope to apply his ideas  time  and effort to “improving” something. Create something and then continually I prove it  and eff the haters  amirite?  He could chalk up his failure here as a learning experience  and if he admits his errors  he might even generate some good will for his new endeavor. Even more so if he “humans up” and steps down as fmf mod  which he’ll need to do anyway because he’ll need the time to work on and promote his new subredit.  Giving them the benefit the doubt  the basic problem here is misplaced ambition  and I’d encourage the person in question to find or create his/her/their own channel for that ambition.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.181840227673561,5274,

Personally  even in that article it seems like the two owners of Rhone have different ideas and approaches on how to market and lead their brand. IMO  if that kind of confusion is at the top  then it makes sense why it trickled down into the AMA turning out how it did.   One of the mods of MFA posted yesterday or the day before that they did not receive any talks of compensations of any kind and they  MFA  offer a much larger platform.   I'd love to reply to more of your post  but I'm currently at work. Thank you for taking the time.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.2494949494949495,5282,

I totally agree with you that FMF is a community - one that mods are also a part of. When I said **our users** I wasn't speaking on a place of ownership. I was speaking as being part of the community. I was a follower of FMF long before I became a mod ~6 years ago. I bought and sold items as a user with other users. What I'm interested in is (and I may be reading your post wrong) what seems like the idea that mods (in any community) are there to keep the subreddit afloat and not seen as *part* of the community. Yet  they're looked at as if they do work for the subscribers of any particular community. I don't see the 1.3m+ users of FMF as ""mine."" Hope that clears it up.   I get what you're saying about the user experience. And I want to preface what I say next as I hope this is a discussion  not an argument. Part of the user experience  in my opinion  are enhancements like subreddit flair  which makes it easier to identify posts  building out AutoMod so that spam posts are automatically removed and you're not bogged down with autobots posting  and (back in old reddit) keeping up with the reoccuring threads in the sidebar. At the end of the day I agree with you about this being a place first and foremost for coupons and deals.

There have been a ton of criticism thrown my way about how I responded this week and users are entitled to do so. I totally get and respect you saying that you would bounce if our roles were reversed  but that's not me. Yes  some things that I've said haven't been taken in the way that was intended  but that's where I prefaced this entire thread with wanting to have a conversation. For me  I understand the frustration of many users  but I also recognize that a lot of the criticism doesn't lie with me as an individual. I've stated my position and opinions clearly in this thread and **I know** that no incentives/deals/goodies were given to me to host the AMA. In that respect  I'll let those nay-sayers think what they want  as they're entitled to. That's why I don't get worked up over some of the more... vocal posts/messages. I also realize this is the internet and fake internet points. The thread was a one-time trial and it's over. I get that the ""damage is done""  but I've learned from it. For me  taking the heat is about perspective. There's no reason for me to get worked up about people calling me this  that  and the other or accusing me of whatever - I can just close the app  tab  screen and return to my real day-to-day life. I'm not going to rile myself up over words on a screen. That's not to say I won't sit here and engage in discussions with users with different opinions  hear out their feedback  and still try to do a half-decent job as a mod - that's not what I'm saying at all.   My ""Why."" I enjoy it. As I mentioned before  I was a regular user of FMF in the early days and I've benefited from the deals posted on here (hell  most of my closet is thanks to these deals). Why I do it is because I am also a member of this FMF community and I know the back-end craziness that takes place to keep this sub relatively spam-free. By being a mod and being able to remove those types of threads  I'm able to clean up the sub so I  along with others  don't have to scroll through a bunch of BS to get to the meat and potatoes. My 'why' also ties back into the first part of this post - these are internet points and I try not to get worked up over what strangers are saying on the internet (**no offense  internet strangers**).

Both of these were achieved organically.  Additionally  there was no request for input from the community. The mods didn’t approach the community with “Hey  we are receiving requests to host an AMA. Is this something you all would be interested in? Can we test one out and make a determination afterwards to see if this fits us?”  It comes off as mishandled in everyone’s end  regardless of whether the AMA were successful or not.

I'm glad there was an AMA for a brand  which if FMF didn't host  it wouldn't have taken place. (MFA mods didn't want it).  Obviously the AMA was pretty awful  but that's not the mods fault.   I agree with /u/Fortitude21 that whether or not the users were fake  its on Rhone for not understanding the medium they were working on. Most charitable opinion is that the Rhone people running this were clueless on reddit (their explanation of the photoshop for one  the bad answers for 2).,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.027777777777777804,5321,

(Emphasis mine.)  NO FLAWS. You know  despite the numerous flaws literally pointed out in the comments directly prior to this comment. His comments on that thread read very much like “It’s not **our fault**. It’s **your fault**.” which seems to be a giant theme for him.  He seemingly has a tendency to want to die on whatever hill he’s standing on and actively looks the other way when given feedback.  But all of this just rolls into the larger theme of “I’m going to do what I want to do  and you all just need to fall in fucking line.”  This is not a mod mentality we want.   > Again  we do not get paid to moderate this sub and many of us are working professionals with families and jobs...  He consistently brings this up. And I get it that we all have lives outside of this sub  but it comes off 100% whiny. First  if being a mod is *such a hardship*  step down so others can do it. Or add additional mods who can ease the burden. Second  I don’t recall this tag line being said by the other two  so the fact that he continues to use it is just cringe. Stop whining.

If he has simply said “I can not determine if they are or are not shills; and I do not want to ban hammer someone on suspicions alone.” that is a stand I can get by. In fact  I will vehemently agree with the “Innocent h til proven guilty.” mentality. But to actively claim “False claim” comes as “I have proof positive that the evidence shows these accounts are legit.”  Those are two very different stances  though they might have the same results. I expect a mod to be able to distinguish between the two instances and articulate the differences.   As far as I can see  he continues to hold by the “False claim” stance and has not doubled back to clarify the stance. (I’m willing to be wrong about this  but the stubbornness shown by him makes me think it’ll take a bit of combing to find the particular comment  which is also ???.)

Yet  they're looked at as if they do work for the subscribers of any particular community. I don't see the 1.3m+ users of FMF as ""mine."" Hope that clears it up.  thanks for clarifying. perhaps i was reading your post through the lens of u/frankum1's previous comments in the other thread  where he repeatedly states that his aim is to _enhance the user experience_  and _to engage_ or _expand the user base_.   the only reason to do such a thing  which involves creating more work for the mods who are already surely overtasked and making changes no one asked for or wants  is to increase **revenue**. it's a bad look  first of all. secondly  for subs like this  it is self-defeating as deals get drained more quickly and in some cases straight up exploited and killed.  moreover  this attitude among mods that they should swoop in  with a sub of this size  and implement top-down changes to ""enhance user experience"" and ""expand its user base"" implies—and serves to establish—a provider/consumer relationship between mods and the community. that's a reversal of the mod/community relationship. mods don't provide ""users"" with ""content."" rather  the _community_ provides the content and mods just clear trash out of the way.  there are over a million subscribers here. this sub isn't even close to its embryonic stage where mods need to get involved. it's self-perpetuating and largely self-maintaining. it's a great example of how reddit should work. and in that situation  mods just clear out spam and respond to community suggestions.  >enhancements like subreddit flair  which makes it easier to identify posts  actually  whatever was done to change the old flair system has made it _harder_ to identify the posts. it's worse. was that particular change made in response to community suggestions or requests?",,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.026309523809523814,5353,

Yet  in my opinion  the potential of collateral damage may offset the benefit. It sets a potentially damaging precedent that may harm the integrity of the subreddit.   As we grow  more brands will be aware and attempt to infiltrate the sub. There is more opportunity for marketing gimmicks and ploys that will simply spam the sub (Imagine if every brand discovered us including the bad  very spammy ones like Zara and Express). All in the name for potential coupon codes?  Then there is the question of the discounts involved. Are they 10% or 50%? Should we risk the integrity of the sub for 15% off Rhones  already expensive products. IMO  no. I will just wait til their stuff hits end of season or sample sale to get those steep discounts. Yet  maybe 15% off Meermin is worth it  since its never on sale.   So  who makes these decisions  what parameters are set  and should they be different for different brands? These all complicate the matter and  subject the sub to risk. I vote  we don't open that can of worms  as the sub is good as it is  no reason to risk it for very marginal benefits.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.0712962962962963,5359,

Like when crypto mining was huge and getting your hands on a GPU at MSRP was an actual deal.  It's fine in r/bapcs when stuff like that happens  I think it should be fine here.  Killshots use to be sorta scarce because of the Jcrew exclusive thing and sold out quite fast.  But  they don't sell out fast anymore  most sizes are just sitting on the website.

The company obviously knew about reddit per the other article  and were familiar with it and even knew how it's built around being 'organic' and that users can be very quick to see through bullshit and can be very harsh. They knew all that.  And still they decided to do an AMA by asking their Facebook group for nice  easy questions; for photoshopping an image to look like their AMA is extremely popular; for possibly using shills; for giving dull  pre-written sounding answers; for getting defensive about getting called out for photoshopping and calling it an 'innocent' mistake; for announcing they'll be giving prizes to the top questions then changing their rules afterwards to be their five favourite questions which means no one in the sub would get any sort of prize or benefit; etc. etc.  My guess? The two doing the AMA were kind of oblivious and thought the AMA would be more popular than it was  and so thought the shill questions and answers and the softball questions and answers would be mixed in with more hard-hitting and 'real' questions from sub members. I think they thought they could just 'pad the numbers' a bit in the AMA to make it look even MORE popular than they thought it was going to be and to make sure some questions and answers shine them in a positive light and let them do a list of bullet point marketing answers amidst real questions from real redditors. But they weren't expecting that those shill questions might be about the only questions they'd get  that the AMA as a whole would be unpopular and that those shill questions and answers were basically the entire AMA lol.  They thought the could get away with a little manipulation to get what they wanted out of the AMA but they were so wrong. They should have known  especially knowing how their company had already been studying reddit and knew how it worked. But they were just stupid  and all the things they already knew about reddit - that users can spot bullshit quickly and be harsh - really bit them hard.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.17811383061383065,5390,

Our community was outreached to host this after [/r/malefashionadvice](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice) declined to. I agreed to provide the space for them to do an AMA in FMF and everything thereafter was on Rhone.

Many of you have shared concern about the mod team receiving some kind of kickback/compensation/discount/freebies/etc. **I want to reiterate and assure you that we did not receive anything for hosting this AMA. FMF has not and will not adopt a ""pay-to-play"" model.** In regards to the number of accounts in the AMA  which were newly created: I cannot definitively (thanks /u/hatfullofgasoline) determine that Rhone did or did not create  ""shill"" accounts - you can read [my personal opinion on that here](https://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/cbp4n6/rhone_ama_discussion/etjagcq?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x).  The AMA was allowed to be posted in FMF as an attempt to engage our community in a different way. FMF has never hosted an AMA and this was used as a trial. **This single AMA is not indicative of the direction or new norm of FMF.** As with most things that we do in FMF  we look to the  users to provide feedback and help guide the subreddit.  Lastly  I'd like to again apologize for how this AMA turned out. Please know that there were good intentions behind hosting the AMA and that our moderator team had no influence in how Rhone went through with the opportunity. This has been a large lesson learned and a wake-up call for the team to put measures in place that increase transparency   make any necessary improvements the subreddit  and are true to the wants and needs of our users.  I encourage you to share your feedback in this thread. This thread is not meant to be an investigation party into whether Rhone created fake/shill accounts - if you feel the need to do so  please contain it to [the other thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/cbp4n6/rhone_ama_discussion/). My hope is that this is a productive discussion for the future of FMF. I will be replying to posts throughout the weekend from my perspective  both as a moderator and an individual user.

And if you want to impress people (and really we all do even the hipsterest hipster  or we wouldn’t be spending all this time on clothes and shoes)  saying your shoes are Saint Laurent are going to impress the ladies way more than Aldens. Never understood the superiority complex some people have about this.   And fyi I’m a proud owner of C&J Handgrades  Santoni Goodyears  Heschung with the sweet norwegian welt  as well as Kiton and Isaia suits. I even have a shitty pair of Aldens. My go-to suit is an Armani  because the design and cut is such an eye-catcher.

J.Crew has taken note of this prevailing internet theme  and has literally begun advertising it right in their item descriptions.  You can't fault them for trying to speak our language - it's working after all  because people seem to be over-inflating the value of these (and other) goodyear welted shoes  specifically because they are goodyear welted.     >   >The thing that no one really seems to remember (or discuss) is that when we're talking about lower quality uppers  goodyear welting [**really isn't all that important**](https://askandyaboutclothes.com/forum/threads/goodyear-welt-vs-adhesive-construction.111134/#post-1198161)**.**   The reason gyw matters is for recrafting; something that you're not going to do with leather of this quality (generally ) because by the time the sole wears out  so will the upper.   With lower quality shoes  the gluing these days is good enough that unless you've found leather that's going to hold up long enough and *look good enough* to be recrafted \[which is extremely rare at this price point\] then you really don't need to worry about the welt  because these days  gluing is good enough to last as long as the uppers.  &#x200B;  Now all of that is not to say that these aren't worth the price  it's more to suggest that there's no reason to over-inflate the value of these shoes just because they're GYW.  At this tier of shoe  there are other options that could have better leather for the price  and even though they're glued  they still may be the better option.  Personally  I plan to order a few and compare them to both the Sperry and the Banana Republic loafers that I recently bought - I'm only really going to take into account the welting  because none of them are going to last me long enough for that to be useful.",,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.10664092664092664,6010,

By the way  you're a *extremely* optimistic to hope that these uppers are going to be anywhere near good enough to resole  unless these soles are really pretty terrible. You're also probably not taking into account that it'll cost you about what you paid for the shoes to have them re-soled  so you'll probably end up just buying a new pair of whatever is cheap at that time.

For a brand like BR  their normal retail prices are almost all 40-50% higher than the sale prices not to mention at a much higher price point than Uniqlo.

2678,thekid747,Rhone AMA discussion,Stop deleting valid discussions about the AMA. Let’s discuss what happened.,self,No video,2019-07-11 13:56:52,596.0,507.0,0.0,frankum1,There’s been speculation here  but I’ll give you a timeline going back six months:  1. January 2019 - There’s a flaw in out automod that means a post can be removed automatically after 5 reports. I submitted a message to the mod team  discussed becoming a moderator and interviewing  and I became a moderator.  2. March 2019? - We try to create a subreddit theme with a snoo and a banner. This was my idea  approved by the mod team; we proceed.  3. Later in March 2019 - A former moderator takes it upon themselves to push some changes we didn’t agree with. We undid those changes (the banner) and then we proceeded.   4. April  May 2019 - Many automod changes to improve filtering of low quality posts as well as rule updates.  5. A week ago - Rhône reached out to our mod team about an AMA. They indicated that they had reached out to r/MFA as well  and with our interest in growing this subreddit  we sprang forward and accepted their request. Plans proceeded.  6. Sometime earlier today - Rhône posted a photoshopped image of a previous post to their social media outlets. We became aware and contacted them  to which they admitted the photoshop and removed. Our team determined there was no ill-intent due to their lack of Reddit activity on their official account plus the extreme nature of the upvote and post counts. We proceeded with the AMA.   7. Slightly Later - The AMA begins and the mod team began checking all accounts for age and suspicious activity. We all agreed that deleting and censoring posts would be obvious and low in ethical standing. AMA proceeds.    8. A little later - someone claimed that young accounts were asking deep questions  perhaps fake accounts as made by the Rhône team. I reached out to a user to see if they had more usernames  but only 6 or so were created. The mod team discussed and our initial reaction was disappointment  but then further discussion with Rhône denying the accusations made it clear to us t hat we are jumping to conclusions. I responded to this post  investigated  contacted Rhône  and the deleted the post in an effort to slow down the mob attack. I was not successful and the mod mentality remains.   9. Slightly later still - the AMA has been fully compromised with negative posts. There is nothing we or Rhône could do     That’s the timeline. That’s the truth. That’s my truth. Claim it as you will  I’ll send anyone screenshots of what I and our team has said to Rhône. Zero financial incentive  zero proof that Rhône made fake accounts. All we do know is they admitted to the photoshop of the post and comment count and immediately fixed it.    Personally  I’m disappointed. I like this community. I and the rest of our mod team has been a lot of time the last six months trying to improve the quality of this subreddit that we enjoy. Many hours spent dialing-in the automod  many hours spent discussing what to do next (if anything at all). There’s no book titled “How to Best Run a Subreddit”.   I don’t know the right words to say here. I’ll likely never meet any of you in person  yet I (and the other three moderators) put in time checking the moderator queue  the reports  and new posts hourly to keep as many of you 1.3M redditors happy and pleased with this community that is why I came on board 6 months ago and that’s why I make this post now.  Unfortunately there’s nothing I can change to the automod  or any other mod tool to fix this issue. I believe  perhaps more strongly than any other mod  that an AMA would allow our community to interact with companies in a positive light  asking good questions and just enjoying this community. I  and the rest of the mod team  realize that we are exposing ourselves to corporate lifestyle and the possibility of selling out. However our intention has and will remain to keep this subreddit on a good path. Maybe AMA’s are good for us  maybe they’re not. But all I can confidently say is that we are trying. We asking each other in internal mod discussions what we can do to keep us strong here.   I will end with this: I have put a lot of time and effort into this AMA and getting it off the ground. Behind the scenes  Rhône has been a professional company despite being absolutely blasted with accusations. I appreciate their time  and their efforts wholeheartedly. I wish this hadn’t gone so far south.   I will lastly say that I deeply respect our mod team for their professionalism in responses both here and internally.  Edit: the point of this post is to paint the picture of my personal impact on this community  my goals for this subreddit  and to make clear what we saw and didn’t.  Edit2: I want to respond to each and every speculation in here  but I cannot. And neither can our mod team. At the end of the day  we cannot tell anyone what to say or feel or believe  we can only censor comments in accordance with our subreddit rules and Reddiquette.  Edit3: okay I’m done responding.  Edit4: last one for now. 1 through 4 provides clarity to why we ever even began this AMA  which was mostly my push. It explains why my username is all over this AMA and why I pushed hard for it.   Thank you for reading.  Edit5: I think I've responded to enough people in here that if you can't see that we tried to make this a good and positive thing for FMF  then I don't know what else to do. There are people who agree with me in giving Rhone the benefit of the doubt  there are people who are being aggressive and saying I'm a shill  there are people who made threatening reports  aggressive verbiage. I and we cannot please all of you. I and I believe that we have been as clear as possible here. What we say and do can always be twisted and turned into perceptions that we didn't intend.

Let’s discuss what happened.,self,No video,2019-07-11 13:56:52,596.0,507.0,1.0,1984AD_,Here's what I've gleaned:  Rhone (u/officialrhone) was hosting an AMA around 3:30pm ET. Some people on the AMA started noticing that a number of questions were asked by users whose accounts were created less than 24 hours ago and their usernames don't appear anywhere else on the internet. Those questions and u/officialrhone's answers to those questions sounded canned and seemed to be carrying a marketing agenda  focusing on initiatives or stances the users hoped the company would align with. When those users were confronted about it  their responses also seemed pretty forced and canned. This led users to suspect that the people from Rhone created fake accounts to boost their own AMA. On top of that  Rhone posted a doctored screenshot of the AMA on IG showing many more upvotes than it actually had.   Even if the accounts were just people from IG brigading and weren't actually fake  there's enough shady stuff in the AMA to leave a bad taste in my mouth. Rhone as a company has lost my trust. The mods deserve some of the blame too: this AMA shouldn't even have happened given the community backlash to it  and after the AMA concluded  the mods tried to cover it up by deleting it. The AMA has clearly eroded the integrity of this sub and I hope the mods don't put on a company-sponsored AMA in this sub again.  Also  I encourage y'all to not use any discount code Rhone might offer to make up for this fiasco  no matter how steep the discount. If nothing else  their clothes aren't real high-quality anyways.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.015555555555555569,6083,

The very first thing you see in the sidebar the mission statement of this sub is:  >The place for coupons  discounts  sales  and deals when it comes to male fashion.  How can you have a Ask Me Anything event in a sub that's for coupons  discounts  sales  and deals? If you come to this sub for coupons  discounts  sales  and deals what will you ask Rhone during an AMA? You should ask about coupons  discounts  sales  and deals since that's what this sub is for  right? So if the whole AMA is just questions about coupons  discounts  sales  and deals it's gonna be one short and weird AMA.  If this sub is still about coupons  discounts  sales  and deals and wants to stay that way this is the only way an AMA with Rhone should have went:  >Hi  we are the CEOs/Funders of Rhone. We are having a special sample type sale just for FMF with prices as low as our previous sample sales or lower. Check out the sale here(link).

Mfa didn’t want because a couple years ago Rhone had posted marketing post on MFA  and then this time messaged individual mods  instead of mod mail so Mfa didn’t respond to Rhône. (The messages weren’t offering any exchange for the ama to take place). Fmf decided to accept the ama  another comment covers that. No talk of benefits to the mods here either.    2.) I don’t think there’s anything to check the accounts “legitness” besides what we can do ourselves.   3.) Hopefully companies see the disaster this was  and realize that AMAs are not the place to push an agenda/marketing but to raise awareness  offer insight into your brand outside of what may be publicly known.

It diminishes the integrity of the subreddit and will set a precedant to allow more companies to simply advertise here. Which we don't want. So when Rhône announced their  AmA  there was backlash to not use this forum as a marketing tool. Generally companies or people use AmAs to market their brand or product. So it was meet with resistance from the community. Then  Rhône posted a fake Instagram picture showing the hype on reddit with a announcement post of 52k up votes. Even though the actual post had zero up votes and the comments within the post were all scrutinizing the AmA. Despite all the scrutiny and fake instagram hype  the AmA was allowed. Though I'm sure there were genuine posts within the AmA  there were some that seemed questionable and the amount of questionable  comments began to look like a red flag.

We have learned by trial-and-error how different the Reddit community is; it’s completely different than Facebook. There’s a whole culture of authenticity. You can’t just create an account and start posting about your brand. That’s not what it’s for  and the moderators will confirm that for you. They don’t want spammy content. If you’re there to just push your product  you’ll be banned.”   &#x200B;  > Bridegan said Rhone has had success on Reddit by being completely transparent and reactive when engaging with communities. Rather than spamming various fashion subreddits with posts about the brand  which would almost certainly get the brand banned from those subreddits  Rhone has focused on only showing up when the brand is mentioned organically by users  and sticks to answering questions and responding to feedback rather than trying to sell the product.   &#x200B;  I can't fathom why they approached this AMA the way they did if they understood how much Reddit values authenticity and hates ""spammy content.""

Frankly I never felt the need to have an account. I do like reading AMAs though  but it always seems like they’re untouchable to get real answers. For example  if Bill Gates or Obama do an AMA  what are the odds they’d answer my question? Really low. So I stayed away. I do like Rhone and they’re a small enough brand that I thought I could get an answer  so I joined and asked. Here we are.   I live in New England and have no relationship to them  I don’t get paid by them  and I don’t know the owners personally. I started buying their clothes at Equinox back when I went there  but now get them from REI and their website. I genuinely like their stuff  and they make the best shorts on the market.   I climb  hike (like really hike  20+ miles a day and ~40 over a weekend of its an overnight)  ski 40-50 days a year  and generally spend a lot of time outdoors in extreme environments. Lulu is shit for my needs  Rhone fills that gap like no other brand. I use them as my baselayer and wear brands like Patagonia as needed for outerwear.   Keep asking me other questions  I don’t know how else to prove anything to you.

This was expressed by many members as soon as the AMA was announced.  You're right  the AMA was not well received in the announcement. But  as we've said  we cannot determine from such a small sample size how accurate those responses were and whether they were biased or not. We still cannot determine  even  because the only reason the AMA went south was false accusations. There was no ""I told you so!"" moment because the AMA went south because the false accusations and not because of poor questions. I stand by this judgment of the situation.  >If there wasn't going to be a financial incentive/benefit coming to the membership of this subreddit it didn't belong in this subreddit since this sub is mainly about benefiting financially.  I think I'll disagree here. We took a gamble and offered no exchange of incentives on either end because we wanted to try an AMA for this subreddit  thought it would be fun and interactive  but they were kind enough to offer $25 discount codes to the top 5 questions. Which they did.   >I think the way you're responding to the critique that's being expressed by the membership is only gonna fuel the discontent and expend the rift between the mods and the members.

There is a huge number of lurkers on all subreddits. They may be a part of the community but in the background. I get what you're trying to do  but it would be very difficult to seperate those who are coming to Reddit only to ask a question and those lurking on Reddit for a very long time and only recently made an account since they have a question.   Also  this will vary from sub to sub  but our AMAs do serve as advertisements for our sub. The Fortnite competitive community is somewhat fragmented between various social media platforms  some of which is limited to specific countries. Having an AMA which may interest someone from a region who may not traditionally use Reddit is really beneficial for us since Reddit is mostly NA/EU dominant. Additionally  some pros who have accomplished a lot competitively but may not have a large streaming presence can grow their brand a bit. I don't see that purpose for this sub though.

There are plenty of cheaper belts that will do the trick just fine out there.   I price my belts based off of the time and materials that go into them. I’m using the best leathers in the world  with hardware that is manufactured in England. My motivation is never to save a buck; I’m constantly looking for better materials.   I have a proprietary buckle design  as well as an aesthetic that speaks very directly to a niche group that values quality over quantity; although a very large portion of my customers have several of my belts.  But most importantly  this is my living and my full time job. I take a ton of pride in what I do and my customer service is the best in the business.   Most people who know my brand know me; Isaac Paul  and you can always reach out to me via email  Facebook or Instagram and I will respond as quickly as I can and treat you as a person  not a as potential sale.

They’ve all held up. Since they switched manufacturing to italy and eastern europe  the interwebs have turned to favoring barbour over belstaff. But I remember a time 5-10 years ago when everyone online thought Belstaff was the shit  and Barbour was what you bought if you couldn’t afford belstaff. I still significantly prefer the aesthetic of Belstaff over Barbour. Belstaff is more “futuristic cool” (despite being a heritage brand)  while Barbour is a bit more farmer hipster. The Weybridge always gets a wow from my friends when I wear it.  I might get downvoted but the Barbour Beaufort  while subtly nice is not going to get that wow factor. The average person on the street won’t notice it. I almost bought a Barbour International but everytime I looked at it  I just wanted a Roadmaster.  $222 is a great deal on a Belstaff,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.29791666666666666,6727,

Quartz is a lot more accurate  and a lot harder to “damage” as their are fewer mechanical parts. Automatic watches have sweeping second hands  upkeep is a more  and if you lose/gain a lot of seconds a day  you’ll have to get it serviced. The most servicing a quartz will ever really need is changing its battery.   Watches have “water rated” numbers  that say what static pressure they are rated for. Keep in mind that it’s static pressure  so swimming can damage a watch even if you don’t go below 100 meters of depth even if it’s “rated” for 100 meters. Also  hot water/shampoo might destroy the waterproof gaskets in a watch so don’t shower with one on  even if it’s like a diving watch. For most watches  they won’t die if you spill coffee on it  but I wouldn’t get an expensive watch wet (quartz or automatic) if I can avoid it  unless it’s something like a dive watch or a watch designed for tough situations like a g-shock.   You are asking a lot of stress questions  so perhaps look into G-shocks  they are vibration/drop/ water resistant quartz watches.
