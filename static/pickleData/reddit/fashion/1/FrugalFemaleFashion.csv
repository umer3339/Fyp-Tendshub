I don't like it because you can't use coupons on those items which means no additional discounts. Modcloth is damn expensive some items. I usually only look at items for inspiration and then buy similar clothes elsewhere. But they had some good discounts recently including that SAVE50 coupon. Why is their sizing so over the place and not uniform for the clothes on their own label? And why is everything extra large wide at the underarms?,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.1414285714285714,2690,

Additionally  the band is far too thin and that's where 90% of the support should come from. Then the straps have too much give  accentuating how little support the band gives  and they're far too narrow. I would not buy these ever. You're much better off investing in a good quality bra that will last you a lot longer and provide proper support.  &#x200B;  Edited to add: I'm a 10DD and the largest size doesn't even fit me properly. These bras are basically designed for people with very little breast tissue to worry about who don't need proper support.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.049107142857142856,2778,

They give me like strange cone tits. For reference I think they actually do the adding inches thing to get band size thing so a 34 inch band for them is actually 5 or 6 inches smaller if you measure it  watch out if you get properly fitted bras anywhere else.

I have worked with multiple mainstream brands. From my vantage point  both consumers and brands are responsible for poor worker treatment and environmental degradation resulting from the relentless pursuit of low prices.  Brands and retailers do pay vendors far below the amount they charge consumers and can probably afford to pay vendors more  but a big part of the reason they do it so is the unpredictability of sales. They may get a huge hit with one style but have trouble selling another 10 styles  so all 11 styles will be marked up a lot to make sure that overall  they don’t lose money. Fashion is notoriously volatile and competitive so the possibility of going completely bankrupt as a company is always very real. Especially after the 2008 recession  everyone is constantly paranoid about going out of business. They are businesses and their primary motive is to make money  regardless of the costs to others. Unless we change capitalism or something  this is how business is.   On the consumer side  retail prices are set based on what customers are willing to pay. Merchant teams at the brands track sales on every single style on a week by week basis so there is actually a lot of data to back up their pricing decisions. People are extremely price sensitive. I know tons of people who are more than well off who always want a “deal” and won’t buy things if they don’t think they are getting a bargain. The recession made this worse when brands cut prices to move inventory and then consumers got used to paying less. I have personally worked with brands that were not the cheapest but didn’t price gouge vendors  fell on hard times  and then clawed their way back to financial stability by slashing retail prices and hammering vendors. Unfortunately  this method works.   I think the biggest problem with the system we have for making and buying goods is that production of goods is disconnected from what the market wants. Sellers are risking capital up front to make something that they think buyers will pay for  but don’t really know  and have to hedge their bets by charging inflated prices in case stuff doesn’t sell. So manufacturing is essentially sophisticated gambling and tons of stuff gets made that may or may not really be needed.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.05280112044817928,2806,

So the ""vote"" is still being cast by people who cannot control that vote. And companies wouldn't price their products the way they are if they expected their consumers to be those with buying power like you're suggesting. They're intentionally priced for low income people.  Putting the onus on individual's to ""police"" companies is privileged af  but it's also kicking the can down the road. Corporations have entire departments devoted to ethics  payroll  sourcing  etc. that can research and make these decisions if they wanted to. The average person walking the street has their own set of major responsibilities and time-consuming tasks every day  and claiming it is on them to research carefully where everything comes from (because this argument isn't just about clothes  it's about food and labor and things as small as what company they buy their gasoline from) instead of making policy-based demands on corporations to just not be fucking scummy is silly.  Second hand is a good alternative  but it's still privileged. Many people don't have access to thrift stores  and/or don't have the time to sift through the options. If you need a t-shirt  you can walk into Walmart or Target or Zara or Forever21 and be out of there in less than 5 minutes. Buying it via thrift can mean those same five minutes are extended into an hour or two to find the color  size  fit  etc. in suitable enough condition within your price range -- and if you buy online  you're risking a garment that doesn't fit or is in worse condition than expected and cannot be returned (i.e. a scary financial investment). Add to it that you cannot thrift fast fashion items most of the time because it is rare that they last beyond a single owner  so even if you're getting nicer items cheaper  you're often still paying a higher price for them compared to a 5 for $5 sale. There are many  many people working 2 - 3 jobs and/or have kids/family members in need who cannot expend that time without losing out on money or sacrificing sleep or eating.",,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.07303854875283446,2824,

Also  to say  >Just because they provide a product now considered vital doesn't mean it was done from a place of goodness.  feels like a bit too humanizing towards corporations  and by humanizing I mean ""simplifying down a fundamental aspect of capitalism and treating it as if it was an ethical decision made by a single entity"".  If there is a demand for something  and a company provides it  and they get money  that isn't a moral ungood in itself. It's a fundamental aspect of our system  because there will always be corporations that provide for any demands of people (i.e. if it's not H&M  it's Forever 21).  And unfortunately  this is an international issue as well. It would be nice if China would suddenly go ""Let's establish a living wage!"" and enforce that  but sweatshops exist because the individuals in them need money at any chance they can get. To deny them the opportunity to work is to hurt their well-being even further. This is why this is a tricky issue; if you ban companies that provide low income employment from selling products in America  the damage goes to the poor globally.  The amount H&M is willing to pay its global workers depends completely on how well business goes  because when you take money away from H&M *they* take it away from the most desperate financially of their workers (not literally of course  but you understand). And because this is an international issue  there's nothing we can do about it right now.

My relationship with fashion is as you may have implied admittedly a new one because I’m at the age where I really want to experiment with what I’m wearing and really have the energy and enthusiasm to think so deeply about it all the time. Also I am a stylist in particular.  I’d describe my dress sense as out there and colorful. The reason I started buying clothes by the outfit because I realised I was buying single bold pieces that I ended up never wearing because I wasn’t happy with how they would inevitable clash with other bold pieces that I loved.  I also didn’t like wasting time deciding what to wear in the morning and then feeling not confident in for the rest of the day in an outfit I made up in five minutes that morning.   I place each outfit on a hanger (that I've thought about for hours previously) and just pick it up in the morning and I’m ready to go. I love each outfit a lot and I don’t have the problem of going through and throwing away a lot of clothes because of this.  Overtime when I’m bored of an outfit  I rearrange them all into a new coordination and put them back on the hangers for me to pick up in the morning since I have a wide variety of stuff  yes there’s so much that naturally fits so well. I do re-wear my clothes more often than not. My only mental issue is where it came from hence why I made this thread.   I’m also not spending a lot of money for someone who is crazy about fashion since I spend up to £50-60 a week which is somewhere around £250 a month but I am aware that there is a cost to the workers involved in the businesses behind them.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.16151034151034152,2847,

I'm not for boycotting it. I'm for being super frustrated about it and about how being ethical about our choices is an incredibly difficult thing to do if you don't have personal or financial privilege  along with the sentiment of OP. Voting with your dollar isn't possible if there's only a few places you can spend your dollar  and the idea that individuals are responsible for policing the markets is dumb for precisely the reasons you mention as well as what I've said. It's a massive issue and the free market is a broken system that fails the lower class (and then they get on Reddit/Instagram and see they're shitty people for not being able to afford financially or have the time to buy ethically).  But to say ""where else would they buy their clothes"" is unfair  too. Fast fashion is a precise problem  where styles change quicks and clothes are made quickly and cheaply with the intention that they will be replaced shortly. Companies focused on simple staples have less of a risky bottom line  and the vast majority of low income people wore these basic staples (or created their own clothes) for a very long time. Ethically buying was certainly still a possible issue  but the unethical corporate choices sprung up like crazy with these fast fashion companies. Should low income people find fashion inaccessible in an era of social media  constant photos  and when every other student in their class is dressed on trend? No  of course not. But let's not pretend that these unethical clothes specifically are tied to not being able to wear *anything.*",,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.026877705627705632,2849,

The order hadn’t even shipped by the time a week had passed since placing it  so I called customer service. Apparently the pants were supposed to ship from a store  and the customer service rep had to call corporate for some reason to get it cleared for shipment. She told me that the order would be shipping within the next 24-48 hours.   Well  the next day  I received a notice that the whole order was canceled because they didn’t have the stock. I was very frustrated because the customer service rep had told me they would be shipping soon (and there was definitely stock available a week prior when I placed the order). I called back and a new representative said she would place the order for me again  because somehow they had stock again. I thought  “Great!” She even said she wouldn’t charge me for shipping because of the trouble I’d gone through.   Well  it’s now a day later and 2 out of the 4 pants have yet again been canceled. Not only that  but I was also charged for shipping when I shouldn’t have been (although the charge is still pending since the order hasn’t shipped).

406,goodbyeblusky,New York & Company has lost a customer,Hi all. Just a small rant (and also a question). I ordered 4 pair of Audrey slim leg pants from NY&Co for my new job  because they were having a Buy 1 Get 3 Free sale. I love these pants  so I obviously wanted to take advantage of the deal.   The order hadn’t even shipped by the time a week had passed since placing it  so I called customer service. Apparently the pants were supposed to ship from a store  and the customer service rep had to call corporate for some reason to get it cleared for shipment. She told me that the order would be shipping within the next 24-48 hours.   Well  the next day  I received a notice that the whole order was canceled because they didn’t have the stock. I was very frustrated because the customer service rep had told me they would be shipping soon (and there was definitely stock available a week prior when I placed the order). I called back and a new representative said she would place the order for me again  because somehow they had stock again. I thought  “Great!” She even said she wouldn’t charge me for shipping because of the trouble I’d gone through.   Well  it’s now a day later and 2 out of the 4 pants have yet again been canceled. Not only that  but I was also charged for shipping when I shouldn’t have been (although the charge is still pending since the order hasn’t shipped). I am so frustrated and truthfully I’m not that crazy about the color of the 2 leftover pants that weren’t canceled. I called today to have them cancel the rest of the order  and the new customer service rep was rude and said orders can’t be canceled. I would just have to return it after I receive it.

Dress suits would typically not fit the business casual bill anyway--that's closer to business formal (unless she meant a dress with a jacket  but that's a different thing). You can definitely overdress the requirement  but you might stick out if you do (not necessarily bad  just letting you know).  Like alohomoramylove said  a vest is a solid option  especially paired with a bow tie. Think something like [this](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a5/9e/2b/a59e2b17a11e70fcf934cf7bac677bb2.jpg). You could also go with [suspenders](http://blogs.presstelegram.com/outinthe562/files/2015/01/CLOTHING.jpg) instead of a vest  or nothing at all if you have an interestingly patterned shirt. [Sweater with a bow tie](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/0c/5b/1a/0c5b1ac69b91b62861815daf464b5289.jpg) is also a GREAT soft butch look if where you're going is cool enough. Something monochrome like [this](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/0d/33/70/0d337030a5efc962073390b200663204.jpg) would also work: it's got a jacket  which is usually more formal  but the styling of it makes it more like business casual.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.12265625,2921,

It was on a sale  we found a coupon code  and a free shipping code too - I think we paid around $130 for all three pieces. She's tall  but not lanky  so we had it tailored. If you're petite and less curvy than she is  you'd probably fit one better (they run small.) When we checked the reviews  we saw that a lot of people who project soft butch had bought them.  She's worn them a lot more than expected  - grad  her work's Christmas party  with a 70s ruffle tux shirt to a prom; swapping out the pants for shorts for another event  with and without a shirt  with a t shirt and sneakers... We'll probably get another - it turned out to be a good investment and it's easily tailored so it will last for years.

Are you looking for actual links to things or just suggestions? what about cropped slacks with loafers or brogues with no socks (OR FUN SOCKS) with a turtleneck (or mock neck) and blazer?  I think the ankle showing would add a tomboyish flare and the higher neckline + blazer is such a chic combo. Also the way you style your hair and make up (if you wear it) could make a difference as well. a slicked back ponytail or high bun can read a little more “strong” or masculine.  edit: also if you decided to just wear a button up  buttoning the very top button at the neck also usually reads a little less fem to me.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.12344444444444445,2925,

It’s hard for me to answer the question since fashion taste and price point are so personal  but I’ll give it a shot. Birkenstocks have a [molded footbed](https://www.birkenstock.com/us/us-about-footbed.html) that is supposed to be more supportive and comfortable. It’s probably more expensive to produce and I don’t think most cheaper shoes have that kind of construction.   They’re also known for being easy to repair rather than replace. You can resole them  replace the footbed  etc. rather than having to throw them out. They can be seen as a quality shoe that is worth the effort to fix. Less wasteful that way  too.

The perfect pair of gym pants are different for every person  but there are some features that they have in common. In addition to having superior fabric technology that absorbs sweat and odour  training leggings must also do the job of helping the body move freely and easily - making jumps and movements without the leggings slipping down. So  if you want to avoid disaster and find pants that perfectly embrace your body  high-waist leggings with four-way elasticity  are a great option.   Why high-waist leggings?   High-waist training leggings can help you make certain that everything is well hidden  given a modest look  have a containing effect and are figure flattering too.  Plus  another great characteristic high-waist gym pants is that they are a perfect match to sports bras and cropped tops  which means that you can rock a super hot look without feeling overexposed.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.3811612364243943,3011,

Give shoes a minimum of one full day to air out and dry between wears. If you have sweaty feet  2-3 days may be needed. Also  take care to wash your feet well with deodorant soap every day and dry them completely  including between your toes. Wash socks after every wear. Prevention is key. Once shoes have acquired an odor  it’s nearly impossible to get rid of it.   To prevent dirt and stains on cloth shoes  spray them with Scotchguard before the first wear. For smooth leather  use a leather waterproofing spray or cream before the first wear and repeat it periodically to maintain the finish. For suede  use a spray specially made for suede.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.08246753246753248,3086,

Unless you know it'll be sturdy enough  I personally wouldn't chance it!  I use disposable wipes on the inside.  I wipe until it comes back clean.  If it's clean but still smelly  baking soda!  You can either dust a tablespoon inside  shake it around  let it sit overnight  and then shake it all out outside. Or  you can make a little baggie of baking soda. Use a coffee filter  fill it with as much baking soda it'll hold  and tie it closed with floss (think like a DIY teabag).  Plus side is you can make a bunch and drop one in each shoe. Reuse until you notice it's not working anymore.   I used to work with teens in residential  so they typically only had one or two pairs of shoes. Kids got stanky stanky feet after awhile!,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.07375000000000001,3091,

Something is always off about it- either the sizing is funny  threads lose everywhere  super tight arms but lose in the body  super cheap poly fabric that holds in heat. There’s always SOMETHING.   Personally I really like using thread up. I have no problem buying used clothing (and you can filter by “new with tags”) I search for brands I’ve had success with before. I really like that the picture is of the exact item you’re getting and I never fall into the online trap of really liking the way something looks on the model and hating it in real life because there are no posh models.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.13265068265068264,3095,

Most of the time they have the same exact items with the same exact names. Romwe is usually cheaper  but it depends. I usually just use shein for their reviews and  copy paste the item name into Romwe's site and compare the total. on another note   haven't bought anything from awhile but past experience Shein items usually deliver faster than Romwe if youre in a rush. Also you can watch YT shein/romwe haul videos if you need a better idea of sizing too!  or also check out /r/fashionreps and /r/RepLadies for some cheaper designer dupes too,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.05416666666666666,3096,

Order experience: I was a little worried since I hadn't used the website before and there were a lot of negative reviews of it online describing long shipping times  which I hadn't read before ordering. Maybe I was just lucky  but my order shipped out in 3 days and I received it 3 days after that (6 days total from order to receiving). All the items came in their own individual plastic bags. They could have used more packing tape on the outside of the box  but nothing was missing in the order.   Quality of items: The items were nicer than I was expecting  and nicer than what I've seen at my local store. I know some companies make lesser quality items to sell in their retail outlets  but most things I bought didn't feel noticeably cheap or low-quality. There were a few items where I wouldn't have bought the items if I knew what the fabric felt like  but the quality/build didn't seem bad. Items made by Joseph A  Jeanne Pierre  and Tahari seemed to be good bets.   Sizing: The website only has ""checkout chat"" for why customers pick items  but no actual item reviews so it was hard to tell sizing online. I'm usually between a medium and a large  and I don't like to wear tight items. I ordered medium for everything and most of the tops actually seemed to fit pretty well. These are the brands I purchased:  *true to size: Joseph A  Green Envelope (larger in the waist  but probably not enough to size down)  Monteau  Jeanne Pierre  Sienna Sky (waist seems tight  but that seems to be a cut issue for the style  not a size issue since it seems to fit well everywhere else)  *larger  size down: Zoe & Phoebe   *size up: Tahari (mostly true to size  but cut thinner in the waist so it does cling slightly)",,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.06009294068504596,3125,

One of the sweaters was somewhat similar to yours  in black. It was a crop length and it looked great on the model  but when it arrived it barely covered my nipples and left the bottom half of my breasts uncovered  so I returned it. the size was completely off. The other one was also cropped but fit alright  so I kept it. When I first wore it  I noticed that the seams on the shoulders/upper arms were too tight and limited my arm movements. It is really poorly constructed and I’m yet to wear it a second time. The belt is fine (esp. considering the price) but sold as a high waist belt and I received a low waist belt. I punched a few more holes and wore it a bunch of times. From that experience my advice is to try everything with attention and only keep what you really like. Check seams  loose threads  lengths of sleeves and legs very carefully!,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.055371260683760685,3250,

Good workwear.  I got a few really cute summer pieces from them last year when they were having a 50% off sale. * Loft - same.  Many sales  all the time.  Reasonable work clothes. * Topshop - has cigarette trousers for like $40 that can be washed many many times.  Be careful though  they run extremely small.  I know their US stores closed  but you can get a lot of their stuff at Nordstrom. * H&M - The sizing is all over and the materials are typically very cheap  but where else can you get dress pants for $15? * Nordstrom Rack - they always have at least a few racks of Calvin Klein or Tahari stuff that's clearly made for the Rack  but it will be modern  appropriate  and matching.  They are also  by far  the best for shoes.  Brands that I enjoy finding there: Cole Haan  Franco Sarto  Sam Edelman  Lucky Brand.  In general  I feel like pants help a lot to determine the formality of the outfit.  Dress pants will instantly make most outfits more professional-looking.  In the same way  jeans or jean-shaped pants will make anything look more casual.  Shoes too.

You definitely have to watch for their sales and you have to realize that not everything they sell is going to be suited to your style. That said  I've gotten some great basics there.  Another solid choice is the Ann Taylor Loft outlet and the Ann Taylor Outlet. When these places have sales  you can get some really great deals on some awesome clothes.  Lastly  I found some solid business casual pieces at Target of all places. For example  I just got a pair of gray Ponte Knit black dress pants them for seven bucks on the clearance rack.
