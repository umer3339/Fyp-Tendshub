12,WhycantIbebetter,Husband hates my style/clothing choices.,"I have recently started trying to dress nicer.

I tell people when they notice I'm ""trying to dress like a grown up"" lol. Anyway a part of this is I want to dress in a way that makes me feel good and feel like I look good. But my husband several times has state how much he doesn't like they new thinga I'm buying. He likes skirts and dresses so I have been buying more of those but I also have found I LOVE kimonos and I have always liked sweaters and cardigans. He basically hates all those things and makes it known he doesn't my clothes. It's hard to feel I look good when he basically says I don't but alot of the things he would like me to wear I do not like. We have had this same issue with a hair cut. I got a cut felt super cute until he saw it an pulled a face. When I talked to him about it late I said I wanted him to think I looked good and literally his face was this üòï and no real comment of reassurance that he still thinks i look good even with the new cut.

We are with ourselves and in our bodies 24/7. You deserve to feel confident and beautiful in what you‚Äôre wearing  whatever your personal style is. You love that kimono? Wear it! Of course we dress up for other people (spouses  colleagues  friends etc)  but we also dress up for ourselves. If it makes you happy  you should do it.   Imo your husband is being a bit of a prat. He‚Äôs your husband  he should think you‚Äôre always beautiful no matter what. Also  what about his style? I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs some things he wears you aren‚Äôt a fan of. You‚Äôre trying to make more of an effort in your appearance  and that is always a journey. If he wants to give an opinion  I think it should be done in a way that is encouraging or constructive (‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt have chosen that top  but the colour is great and you look beautiful‚Äù). I‚Äôd honestly talk to him about how his comments make you feel. He might think he‚Äôs helping  but it sounds like his critiques are coming across super harsh.   Personally I think you should wear what makes you feel comfortable  confident  and beautiful. But I understand wanting to wear things he likes. Maybe you could save outfits on Pinterest or find things online that you like  and then send them to him and see what he thinks. He could also do the same. I think if he‚Äôs going to express his dislike  he should try and say why he doesn‚Äôt like it. I find it hard to believe a man hates every single cardigan in the world. Is it the material? The cut? Using this info you can find things you like that are more in line with his tastes.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.3762095238095238,2315,0.0

On one hand I want to tell you to screw him and wear what you want  but I understand how much easier it makes life to have your spouse support your clothing and style choices. He could be reacting poorly for a few reasons: maybe he just doesn‚Äôt like change. Completely understandable  change is scary for a lot of people. If you suspect this is the case  you should talk to him about what specifically he isn‚Äôt liking about your style changes. Does he think your haircut is too young/old/short/modern? Get to the root of what specifically he doesn‚Äôt like. He could also be nervous that in finding your new style and starting to feel yourself more  this will catch the attention of other suitors who may take you away from him. Maybe he saw this happen with a friend in the past? Maybe this happened to HIM in the past? Whatever the reason ends up being  I think it‚Äôs really important for you to explain why you‚Äôre making your changes and how good it makes you feel. Explain how his reaction to your haircut was hurtful when you were really excited about it. Explain how important it is to you to feel confident in your clothing choices because clothing is an expression of ourselves. Loosely we could call it art. I do hope that helps  and I hope you continue to find clothes you really like and feel good in!,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.10977758352758353,2318,

Tip #1: Be observant of clothing styles and fashion all around you. You‚Äôve been accustomed to uniformed clothing for some time now  time to venture out. From classic movies to modern television shows  from runway pieces to streetwear  from friends and family to cultural design. Take those  ‚ÄúOh  I love that look‚Äù and try them for yourself. Please DO NOT tell yourself that you cannot wear a certain style that you like until you‚Äôve tried it on and explored it for yourself. If you like kimonos  try wrap dresses with wide belts. IMO Cardigans are staple pieces that belong in your wardrobe  it‚Äôs about finding the right fit and fabric. Explore fashion and style on your terms and comfortability. Your confidence will develop and strengthen when you feel good about yourself. Tip #2: When you‚Äôre watching something or viewing something with your husband and see an outfit you like  point it out to him. Be very cautious of this  as you DO NOT want to focus on the absolute size and figure of the actors/models/people wearing what your admiring. Focus on the color  fabric  print  style  etc.; saying something like  ‚Äúwow  that cardigan that Pam is wearing at the classy Christmas party is pretty/cute/fabulous‚Äù. Try to get his opinion on the clothing article and style. This may help you feel less personally judged and may induce some actual feedback from him. But keep it genuine  only mention an outfit/style if YOU really like it.  Tip #3: Discuss men‚Äôs style and fashion with him  ask him what he likes and point out men‚Äôs styles you like. This will level the field of critiquing one another‚Äôs fashion and provide both of you with the opportunity to discuss what clothing represents to you personally in a way that doesn‚Äôt assault or attempt to control one another‚Äôs creative/comfortable fashion vibes. When you point out men‚Äôs fashion/style you like  be sure he knows you‚Äôre focused on the clothing  NOT the person wearing the pieces. Saying something like  ‚Äúthat jacket he‚Äôs wearing is awesome  you‚Äôd look so good/handsome/hot/amazing in a that type of jacket.‚Äù Again  be genuine and only say it when you mean it. Lastly  you‚Äôre not always going to receive others‚Äô approval for your fashion choices  including your husband  but that doesn‚Äôt mean that you cannot introduce pieces YOU love into your wardrobe. My husband and I are completely open and honest about our style/clothing (including haircuts)  sometimes I just accept that I don‚Äôt like what he‚Äôs wearing because he‚Äôs comfortable/confident. The only times I personally focus on what he critically thinks of an outfit I‚Äôm wearing is date night or when we‚Äôre attending an event that represents him/us. I listen to his critiques and I take them as his opinions of women‚Äôs fashion and his taste  not my body/style. We‚Äôve been married for 17 years and our styles have evolved with our maturity and relationship growth. You got this girl! Be brave and confident in yourself. I hope this helps.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.20101351351351351,2321,

Of course you should be ""allowed"" to wear clothes that make you feel confident  beautiful  and mature. You should also obviously be able to choose your own hairstyle. It's your body and you're the one who has to deal with the mental/social discomfort of not styling yourself in an age-appropriate way that accurately expresses who you are to the people to interact with on a daily basis.   On the other hand...maintaining a respectful  committed relationship with another person requires some amount of compromise and consideration. It's partly your duty to do what you can to remain physically appealing to your partner. If he was suddenly intentionally doing something that you found unattractive  that would hurt your relationship on some level. If you want to make a life change like this  part of your job is to figure out what he styles likes/dislikes (and if that's even the real problem). Some people are just resistant to any type of change because they feel threatened or insecure in some way. They don't want it to change the nature of your relationship. For example  some people will criticize their partner's (or sister's  friend's  etc) appearance when they start to lose a noticeable amount of weight even if it makes them more conventionally attractive and feel better. It's just a weird flaw in human nature. If he dresses very casually and is interested in changing but doesn't know how to or is worried about the social implications  this could be an insecurity issue. Your solution might be to help him find new clothes rather than changing what you're buying for yourself.  If you're in a healthy relationship  you should be able to talk to your husband about the changes and explain why they're important to you. It's not just about the clothes and hair. After that  you'll have to figure out if it's a surface-level styling problem or a deeper fear-based issue before you can really take any steps towards finding a solution that works for both of you. Good luck with everything and I hope you're able to find a way to work through it together and end up closer than ever.",,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.23774817136886106,2322,

I'm actually in the process of throwing some of my clothes out right now.   I think the biggest deciding factor for me was just looking at all my clothes and dividing them between what I would actually wear and what I think looks nice. if it's something that's truly my style and I feel really comfortable in  then I keep it. As for the other clothes  maybe I think they're cute  but they're not items I'd choose for MYSELF. Rule of thumb: if you havent worn it in the past 3 months  consider throwing it out (unless it's just the wrong season for it). See if you can sell some of it to a consignment store!   Also  as for clothing with memories attached  taking a picture of the item has always worked for me. Take a nice picture of the item or of you wearing the item and save it  maybe even print it out.   Keep max 3 t-shirts and 2 pairs of pants  for gardening  and alternate between those.   Good luck!,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.17933673469387754,2344,

I have a few reasons why I think this isn't a case to get up-in-arms about:  Firstly  JPG is a classic French brand really deeply steeped in French culture. As far as I've researched  there are no chapters of the KKK in France or French history. As the KKK is a much more active and known organization in North America  I feel like that makes it less likely that would be something JPG would want to explore in his work.  Furthermore  if you look at the rest of the collection  that silhouette repeats itself 4-ish times  with different colours  details and fabrication. Which is another factor that leads me to believe that the KKK wasn't the inspiration behind that dress  but it's more about it's conical shape. [1](https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5d1caf506ef9d00008db9e2d/master/w_400/_FIO0657.jpg) [2](https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5d1cafea35b896000836387d/master/w_400/_FIO0707.jpg) [3](https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5d1cafe4f562230008492ed5/master/w_400/_FIO0766.jpg) [4](https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5d1caf5635b896000836387b/master/w_400/_FIO0614.jpg) As an aside  I think this particular outfit is like a customary ""wedding dress"" closing the show  and I'm pretty sure as the designer is nearing his 50th year in fashion it could also be a reference to something he made in the past.   Lastly  conical hoods have been used many many many times for uniforms through out history. It started with the [Flagellants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagellant) in the 14th century within Europe  and in more modern times has appearing in Italy and Spain during Easter  used by [various religious groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capirote#Other_uses_(KKK)) associated with the Catholic Church. But  I also realize it has been appropriated by the KKK and the symbolism of a conical hood has changed in some parts of the world.   With all that said  is it possible that the intent of this outfit when it was created was to be some kind of a humorous take on a KKK robe? It's possible  but i sincerely doubt it.",,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.13760964912280702,2361,

Discussion,I am terrified of the idea that we will get rid of most of the brick and mortar stores soon and will have to solely rely on the online shops for everything. While I get it that its convenient to shop from the comfort of your couch I can't help but feel that the convenience ends there. We don't get to see and feel the material  check the fit and how the style looks on us  pair it with shoes  belt or any other accessories we think will look good with it  when we are shopping online.

We're often approached by mom-and-pop small stores that sell Korean clothes in HK.  These sole proprietors are elderly women who speak just Cantonese. Some are illiterate.  Most deal with a Seoul company called ""DLS"" whose agents arrange for  or buy  clothes in Dongdaemun that DLS ships to HK. But DLS requires them to use a middle-man in HK to wire money. Why? DLS warned that if they receive money directly from HK in their bank accounts  their Korean banks will start probing and asking  too many meddlesome questions. Solicitor-client privilege bars me from unveiling more - suffice to say that DLS looks sketchy.   Thus what are some reputable buyers/agents  who can buy clothes from Dongdaemun and ship them to HK?

185,joanng123,Dear Fashion Industry,Dear Fashion Industry   We‚Äôve been friends a long  long time (I turned 50 this year)  so I‚Äôd like to ask for a favour. Not just for me  but for everyone. Can you give us ONE thing that we can wear without worrying? You know what I mean. We search the internet to figure out exactly what shade and fit our jeans should be this month. What size should my purse be? Should my shoes look pointy  squared or round?   It would be great to have one article of clothing that I can wear without any doubts; without wondering if it‚Äôs ‚Äúin style‚Äù or not. Can we start with belts? Can you stand up and shout ‚ÄúWear whatever belt you want! It can be skinny  wide  pink or rainbow striped. Wear one  wear two. No one will judge you  so go for it!‚Äù ?  Back when I was a young girl  the choice of what I wore came from my heart. If it made me smile  and lifted my soul  I put it on. I didn‚Äôt worry about what my friends would think. It was an inner decision of my own. I wore it because it felt good and I liked it  not because you told me it was the right colour  length  or texture. Not because someone else was wearing it. I was an individual!   I knew you were there  but I didn‚Äôt feel like you were telling me what to do. I felt like you were a source of inspiration. Then things changed. I felt like I needed your permission before I walked out the door. When did you become my parent? Don‚Äôt get me wrong. I really appreciate all your years of creativity and options  but it‚Äôs time to get back to the independence of my youth. If you want my opinion  I think it‚Äôs our obligation to think for ourselves and form our own opinions. We should wear what we like. If we liked it 10 years ago  why can‚Äôt we still like it now?   We waste too many good clothes because they‚Äôre ‚Äúout of style‚Äù. Wool comes from sheep  silk from a worm  cotton comes from a plant that grows in the ground. Are our choices leading to the abuse of our planet? All those cotton plants had to be watered in order to grow and be processed to make so many shirts  jeans  chinos  ‚Ä¶ then we toss them out only to grow more cotton. We toss them out because they had pleats  the waist was too high  the leg was too wide or they were the wrong colour. I consider myself a champion of the environment. We could be growing something else on that land. Something edible.   Take out that shirt or dress from your past and let‚Äôs not call it an old style. Let‚Äôs call it ‚Äúmy style‚Äù. Wear it for nostalgia and for the good of the planet!,self,No video,2019-05-29 05:16:13,0.0,15.0,0.0,,,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.0,2488,0.284
