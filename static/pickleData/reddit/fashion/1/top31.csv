It is very breathable  incredibly smooth and will get softer the more it is worn and washed. One downside to linen is that  because it is so lightweight  it is often times a little bit see through. If this is a problem  you can always wear an undershirt (v-neck of course  don’t want a collar showing). Linen is normally relegated to warm weather wear  but during the summer months people wear it both formally and casually. Be forewarned this fabric will be wrinkly.  Most of the images are linen as its more natural color  white  or light blue. Skip to the end of the album for black linen. Images were added to the album if the WAYWT poster mentioned they were linen or if the retailer listed the fabric tag as being linen or at least mostly linen.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.187990196,11160,

If your clothes smell then there are likely microbes eating off of the minerals oils on your clothes. That's likely bad for the longevity of your cloths.  &#x200B;  Also  here are some tips for keeping your clothes lasting longer:  &#x200B;  1. Wash on cold 2. Wash and dry clothes inside out 3. During wash make sure to zip up zippers and generally get sharp/heavy objects out of the way as much as possible. Don't wash heavy clothes with light clothes. 4. Minimize detergent use 5. Deal with stains/spills quickly 6. Air dry on rack instead of using dryer 7. Be aware of your posture. Resting elbows/arms on table  having bulging pockets  wiping hands on clothes  etc all increase the wear on your clothes. 8. Wear the appropriate clothes for the situation. If you're going to be getting dirty or are moving a ton lean more towards more durable and washable fabrics/clothes. Same with shoes. Have separate pairs for hiking/rain/etc that are more durable and easily washed. This will make your other shoes last longer and save you money in the long run even though you will own more shoes at once.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.10462963,12491,

In other words  move from the person in the field  to the person who decides what programs in the field get funded 2. I made a master list of potential employers  and ranked by interest. Your best shot at breaking into the USGOV/UN agency networks is straight out of school  so I ranked these highly. 3. For the top 5 institutions  I started looking at the company website job listings. Most of these never made it onto job aggregators. I also specifically checked the consulting portal  which is separate from the employment portal 4. I asked 4 of my advisors/colleagues if I could list them as references 5. I waited. I know the fiscal year ends in June for most large donors. You'll get a spate of last minute spending in May  and then a large number of listing in September/October as funding trickles down to NGOs and subs. Last October is when I started applying 6. I paid attention to my University job listserv. I was lucky to attend a namebrand school with a great network 7. I stayed in contact with past colleagues casually  so when I started looking  I could ask them to throw me any jobs they saw. This is vitally important in international health  as many of the high paying consultancies are posted in-country and won't make it into any job board 8. I applied to jobs from references  university list-serv  and job portals  in that order of priority",,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.149347718,2056,

My boss happened to quit and start his consulting firm just as I left for the Ph.D. They brought me on for about 20% effort while I was doing coursework. I worked with faculty on data management and analytics of large studies  which was my previous job. I developed a reputation for being able to fix mismanaged datasets and got referrals from faculty to other organizations.   To date  I've only worked with three organizations  on over ten projects. One of those organizations was a referral  the other two I got my foot in the door through a cold application. On all three  I was able to develop a reputation for high-quality work and was given follow-on work and expanded roles (and expanded salary). Most of the work started out in rudimentary data analysis  and I was able to shift towards strategy  writing papers  and implementation science as I became the subject matter expert on the dataset.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.062063492,2057,

What’s the problem you’re trying to solve?  2. Would the time  money  and resources be better spent on a different intervention that could save more lives/reduce morbidity?  For number 1  I assume you’re targeting gun accidents  which total about 500 people killed annually. A USA Today article I just saw put child accident deaths at about 80 in 2018. Training does nothing to prevent intentional deaths such as suicide and poverty violence.   For number 2  you have to estimate some costs. There are 132 853 K-12 schools in the US. You cant teach a whole school training at once  so you’d likely need on average 20 training modules per school (guessing)? A training class needs to last likely between 4-8 hours. I estimate cost of instructor salary at $25 per hour. Multiply those out and the cost of education is $266-531M a year.   Half a billion a year possibly to train all students. What would the effectiveness rate be? Would it even prevent half of the deaths? Of the 80 killed in a year  and the value of of a statistical life at $9M  saving half would be $360M  possibly but not making up the costs of the program.   Could half a billion be spent differently to save more lives?

There is no singular gun culture in the US. Gun culture in the projects of Baltimore looks a lot different than gun culture in the Ozarks.

Treating it as a toy leads to accidents  that’s about it. Nobody is committing mass shootings because they think a rifle is a toy.

Grad schools generally look favorably upon those with volunteer experiences like the PC and you can also apply to Coverdell Fellowships post-service that can help offset the cost of a masters. There are quite a few nurses who go into the PC either to get exposure to working with different populations or for career changes.

Find something that peaks your interest  then go to your county health department and ask what groups/ meetings they have that are open to the public or for outside agencies/ professionals.

The thing with Harley is that they've made HUGE improvements that even sport bike riders and younger riders would appreciate.  They've pretty much pissed off their old customer base by ditching the Dyna.  But the replacement bike  the Softails running the Milwaukee 8 motor  are significantly improved.  Way better suspension  way smoother engine  better handling than before.  As long as the motor holds up to the abuse  Harley has a fucking killer bike on their hands.    But the old timers are angry that the Dyna is gone.  Traditionalists  where Harley is  for once  trying to get with the times  and are doing a good job of it.  So they're trying to appeal to a younger crowd now.  And with the young crowd chopper scene doing really well  it's a smart move on their part.

I dont remember how much my insurance was back in my college age era.  I just remember I was paying $400 a month for my truck  plus over $100 insurance  plus gas.  Then I bought a 2008 harley for $10k brand new and rode it so much I ended up selling the truck and just riding the harley for like 2 years.  Bike payment was $150  insurance less than $100  and gas was like $5-$7 a tank.    I've had about 6 different bikes  2 of them harleys  and out of all of them I always felt the most comfortable and ""at home"" on the harley.  I agree most people aren't considering them when shopping  but damn near everyone I talk to that rides a metric cruiser tells me theyd like to have a harley too.  I always equated it to when I tell people I'm ex-military  there's always the inevitable ""yeah I was gonna join  but..."".  ""I was gonna get a harley  but..."".   I dont get hung up on what people ride  my tattoo doesnt say ""harley""  it says ""forever two wheels""  but harley will probably be my main bike from here on out.  I think if you're really serious about riding  you should consider a Harley  especially the new M8's.  If you just want a bike to satisfy some temporary spark  sure  drop 3 grand on a throwaway metric.  I've had 3 of them  they're awesome.  I think it all boils down to what you want as a biker.  But IMO Harley is actually putting effort into shedding that stigma of ""overpriced  overrated"".  Up until this 2019 streetbob  the ""best"" bike I'd ridden was the Kawasaki Vulcan Classic 1600.  But now this Streetbob has made me feel like I just discovered motorcycles again.",,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.220477502,4458,

Theres a pretty good chopper scene going right now  big groups of young riders building custom choppers and bobbers for cheap.  Harley is all over it  marketing-wise.  Selling 70s style 3/4 metalflake helmets in their stores  their posters featuring chuck tailors and denim vests.  Check out the Lowbrow Custom/Biltwell chopper stuff on YouTube and tell me Harley isn't try to attract those guys lol.  The new bikes and style are straight out of a lowbrow customs group ride video.  It's almost like Harley is trying to match the current bike scene rather than pander to the R.U.B's.

Do you recommend taking an online class for your 1st semester  I am planning to take 3 classes  Epi 1  Intro to Biostats  and an elective (online)? 2.

Thank you!,self,No video,7/11/2019 2:50,13,10,0,swisor24,My personal advice is to take classes such as policy and environmental online  but not epidemiology. Also  I had friends that had a difficult time with biostats online. I think it depends on your learning style. Utilize your TA’s!   I recommend taking disease detectives as an elective.   Join the UTSPH Facebook page. So much advice as well as people giving away or selling their textbooks.  Another point is: you get out of it what you put in it. Example: You can get an A in environmental class and not learn a thing. However if you care and want to learn the material  you will put in the work.   Last thing  It’s easier to get a job on campus when you talk and connect with your professors. I was a research assistant while pursuing my MPH. I applied to a lot of the school’s positions online and didn’t hear back once  but got to know my professors and got a job easily.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.001190476,1727,-0.001

I would recommend doing that actually. Some of the online classes can be less rigorous and it’ll be a good balance to balance out the difficulty of taking biostats and epi for majors right out the gate  2. My favorite transferred to another university but this really depends. Are there specialties you’re interested in or what makes a professor good in your eyes?  3. I took it on a whim but I really liked Water Environment. The load outside of class was light but the time I spent in class was really valuable. A lot of other folks who wanted to do more infection prevention stuff took a couple electives they really enjoyed for that. I can ask if that’s up your alley  I know at least one does infection prevention now  4. I started off for the first semester going to school full time with no part time job. Then I found a part time job related to the field a bit later and managed it fairly easily. I know a fair number of students do that.

I have a few questions for those who (or who have not) attended UTSPH.   1. Do you recommend taking an online class for your 1st semester  I am planning to take 3 classes  Epi 1  Intro to Biostats  and an elective (online)? 2. Are there certain professors that you really liked that you recommend? 3. Are there certain classes (electives) that you recommend taking? 4.

Online classes for electives are a good option  but I would not recommend them for epi or biostats classes throughout your time at UTSPH. It's easier to ask questions and be more engaged with an in-person class and these are the courses that you'll need to pay attention in. It's also good to take these classes in person from a social standpoint since most other people in the epi department will also be taking these courses so you can make connections with classmates. Definitely  take epi 2 in person (it's a survey design course where you have a partner so being there in person makes life much easier). It looks like Bing Yu is teaching epi 1 in the Fall. I had her for epi 1 and liked her. She presents the material in a clear way and if you read the textbook then you shouldn't have any issues (but it never hurts to make friends with the TAs).  2. Also 3. Blake Hansen is great! I think he teaches epi 1 and 3 now. Alfred McAlister teaches courses in the Health Promotion and Behavioral Sciences department  so he might be teaching the core course for that area? He's a character and his class was great! If you like ID stuff  then Lu-Hu Hwang teaches a pass/fail course called Epidemiology and Control of Infectious Diseases. Han Chen teaches a class on R programming in epi and I highly recommend that class too.   I graduated in December 2018  but some of the professors that I had and really liked are no longer there. There's always a lot of turnover in who teaches intro to biostats  so you would need to talk to a current student for insights on that one. You can PM me if you have other questions and I can see about putting you in contact with a friend who is in the PhD program there.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.365208333,1729,

I figured this semester I would do the 3 classes  and gauge if I can handle more or less for Spring 2020.   Personally  a professor who enjoys the content and can explain the content well is a trait I find good in a professor. I've taken a lot of classes in undergrad that were taught by professors who would come into class  give a powerpoint presentation and that was it. They wouldn't even be sure what they were talking about so I had to go back very often and teach it to myself.  I'm not sure if I have a specific route I want to go in epi  so I'm still kind of figuring it out. With that being said  I think disease tracking is really interesting  and to be honest I'm not sure if I would be super interested into going into pure research  but that's just me.

I know I'm late but I'll ask anyway   I thought read on the last AMA that you outlet a lot to Japan and make fewer pieces comparatively for sale in your own shop. Is this still the case? I think you said you only made 70(?) pairs of pants a year?   I know you don't remake the same run twice but are there styles and cuts that you always have new iterations of each year? ie  can I expect more balmacaan coats next winter season?   Do you make suits or would you? Even if just sold as separates it would be great to get a SEH Kelly suit  Also  is it possible to get a list of the Japanese stores that stock your items?

We're just a two-person operation  but the factories with whom we work are scattered around the country  and around London  and I think succeed and struggle to varying degrees with labour supply. In London  there is a large pool of cutters and machinists  but only a small number of them are capable of making well more complex styles of garment. So  when things are busy  there is something of a bottleneck in production. And  in quiet times  there is the risk that workers will go to other factories for work: they are all quite capable  so it doesn't so much matter where they're working so long as they have a machine and something to make.  Outside London  I think labour supply is more difficult. In some of the more remote parts of the country  the workforce in the factory tends to be older  and with much longer tenure. More of a ""job for life""  you know. Training and apprenticeships are offered — which isn't the case in the faster-paced factories in London — but I think it can be difficult to maintain the quality of work which the factory might have established over the decades.

Our main market is Japan  and then the States and Canada  the UK  France  and the Nordic countries. More or less in that order. When we started  it was mostly UK customers  but that has waned somewhat  while Japan and the other regions have grown.  Brexit isn't something that we think about at all as a business. We are optimistic that it won't cause too much disruption  and that what disruption it does cause will be surmountable with hard work and nimble adaptation and decision-making.

The trench and its pockets / belt are the way they are for good reason  and we don't intend to change it any time soon. I must admit that belt loops are something I swore many moons ago to never include on our garments — irrational  I know  but something I am sticking to — and thus the trench will remain thus. There are other reasons for the design  of course  foremost that it ties in with our design philosophy of one element doing multiple jobs.  If you wish to tie it at the back to achieve a ""waisted"" look — i.e. to pull the body together at the back — then you can do that by moving the sliders at the back of the belt further apart or closer together. It doesn't have quite the same effect as a tied belt  but it is close. And if you wish to tie it at the back because you don't want the belt swinging around or potentially working its way free and going AWOL  then again — the sliders at the back ensure you have just the right length at the front  and the fact the belt runs under a channel of considerable length at the sides means there's very little chance indeed of it ever going missing.

We have long accepted that zips will never be part of the equation here  which doesn't fully preclude making this or that  does mean that our collection has gone away perhaps from more technical styles of jacket or coat which rely on zips to function well.  The same goes for very lightweight materials that would be useful for things like hoods that fold into collars. Like you have on some military styles like field jackets and cagoules and suchlike. We don't have access to these materials so will likely never make a foldaway hood.  Beyond that  though  I like to think that we can tackle anything we like  so long as we put in the hard yards of thought and design. Often we take the long way round (e.g. our parka employs buttons and buckles in quite a traditional way for what is otherwise  at least to my mind  a fairly high-spec technical garment: I think it was our ""white whale"" for quite a number of years).   But we wear all of this as an advantage or idiosyncrasy  rather than a limitation  so that our garments hopefully don't look too much like those of other brands.  Right now I am thinking about trucker jackets  engineer jackets  cook jackets  fishing jackets -- all of which I think we can tackle and hopefully will do over the next 12 months.

The balance has shifted the other way since our last AMA  and now everything we make we make for our workshop and website. We have pulled out of wholesale to focus exclusively on direct sales to customers. It breaks us free of the seasonal cycle  and means we focus more on each individual piece  rather than a collection as a whole. We still have a complete range -- indeed  a more complete range -- but we have now more time to really make the most of every piece.  The whole collection is iterative  so pieces go and come back  and each time hopefully come back stronger. The balmacaan is one such example  as I think it has been through four or five iterations. There will be a new version in tweed this autumn  yes  and while it will look very similar to the one currently on the website  a few changes have been made to the pockets and the space around the armhole  for instance. We make these changes on the back of customer feedback  or through observations or ideas over time. So  while the balmacaan is a key tenet of the collection -- indeed  every piece is a tenet -- there will often be changes within that to ensure everything is as strong as it can be  and each piece as strong as each other.  We've no plans to make suits. It isn't our forte  and the process is different to the casual outerwear in which we hope to specialise. There are fewer creative opportunities for suits  too  because as soon as you start deviating from tradition you run the risk of making something unfit for purpose (i.e. for a suit  for work or formal occasions).

I have quite a proactive approach to designing the collection  with a roadmap of sorts of what I want to develop each year or half-year. Each piece takes two or three months to fully flesh out and develop  and I suppose I have five or six pieces at any given moment in my head. I am not influenced by the work of other designers in a conscious way  but since I am submerged in the industry  I can't help but pick up on the ideas of others — whether for a pocket or collar or certain type of stitching. But I hope it is not overt  and I try not to do what has already been done: otherwise  I see no point in doing it  can't get excited about it  and I surely wouldn't be able to present it with clear conscience.

The topcoat has gone into early retirement  but the tielocken  which is sort of the same thing but slightly more flamboyant  is set to return in September in a subtly textured woollen cloth known slightly misleadingly as Bedford cord. I am fairly sure we're making that in navy.  Another one which fits the same sort of niche in a wardrobe as the tielocken is the Chesterfield. If the tielocken sits on the more flamboyant side of the topcoat  then the Chesterfield is more conservative. It has a similar configuration of pockets to the topcoat  and is about the same length  but is single breasted. We are making it in the same Bedford cord (not cord as in corduroy  just to clarify) as the tielocken  and in (I think) navy and charcoal. There are one or two other aspects of the Chesterfield which I hope will prove quite novel  such as a semi-raglan sleeve  which is quite unusual and which we haven't done before.  The peacoat and duffle coat will both also return in a heavy  dark navy woollen.

I'm afraid that 44 in jackets and 38 in trousers is likely to be the largest size we'll do for the foreseeable future. We do intend to get around to XXL and beyond at some point (and XXS  come to think of it) -- but it's not near the top of our to-do list  in truth.  Because we are such a small operation  we can't easily cater for sizes outside the norm -- at least not in a commercially viable way. The sheer manpower of increasing the size of the range by 25% (or whatever the percentage would be) is one thing. But also  and more pertinently I think  is that don't manufacture sufficient quantities to make efficient the cutting of  say  seven different sizes within one style. (The fewer sizes you cut  the higher your efficiency  both in cloth usage and in the prices a factory will charge.)  Sorry  Michael — that isn’t very constructive  is it?   I think this is one of those things where larger fashion companies have an advantage  and that little ones will always struggle.

Making the first collection of garments involves having the idea in the first place  formally designing it — whether that's a quick sketch and a list of details or a full-blown technical specification — and then making a pattern. Pattern-making is a specialist skill  and unless you have it yourself  you need to enlist a pattern-cutter / pattern-maker  who will translate your sketch into a ""blueprint"" which a factory can follow to cut and make the garment. A toile / prototype might also be made at this juncture as a proof of concept  and as a useful guide for the next stage.  Once you have the pattern  and you're happy with it  it will need to be graded into other sizes (e.g. small  medium  or large).  You then take your set of patterns to a factory  along with your cloth and lining and buttons (as applicable) and labels. They will make for you a sample.   If you're happy  you can proceed to production (and if you're not  then you revise the pattern and make another sample). For this  you need the right amount of cloth — if you're making ten jackets and they each require 2m of cloth then you order 20m of cloth — and the same for buttons  and lining  and labels. The only thing in my experience a factory will supply is thread.  Does that help answer your question?",,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.19754902,10770,

The segments of the market that you mention are  I think  are a small piece of a larger pie. We try to offer garments which are fairly ""straight down the line""  such that irrespective of pervading trends within certain niches  we have something for everyone. If there is a down-turn of ""pocket-square and loafer"" outfits  for instance  then perhaps we will sell fewer of our SB3 jackets and more tailored styles. Likewise if workwear takes a nosedive: our work jacket won't do as well  and nor perhaps more workmanlike materials. But a peacoat or duffle coat or shirt or ""standard trouser"" will hopefully withstand these twists and turns. It is a cliche  but there are classic forms in men's clothing — such as the aforementioned  but also things like bomber jackets  raincoats  and popover shirts — that are always pretty mainstream come what may  at least within a certain demographic and age-profile.  On a personal level  I love to look at and take influence from all types of clothing  whether that is catwalk-friendly ""streetwear"" or positively antique workwear.

Since we pick and choose suppliers each season  rather than having a continuous supply  *if* Brexit proves disruptive in that regard  then perhaps we'd give the tweed of Donegal a miss for a few months. I think we skipped it last year  actually  anyway  so while it would be a shame  it wouldn't upset things too much.   A chance to explore tweed from another part of the Isles  maybe? Scotland or Yorkshire. And I did just this morning receive some lovely tweed from a mill in south-west Wales  come to think of it.   Since we have quite a small collection  there is only room each season for five or six different mills  and yet many times that number still left to explore.

Our collection has grown steadily -- we have added at least three coats  three jackets  more trousers  knitwear  so that on reflection it is now actually quite large — and the quality of materials and design is higher. And our customer-base has grown steadily  too  in a snowballing sort of way  with customers telling their friends and family and embroiling more and more people into our web of preposterous outerwear and the occasional shirt and trouser.  I have learned a lot about design  and have a much clearer sense now of what does and doesn't belong in the world of S.E.H Kelly. I suppose in that sense we have narrowed our focus  and don't experiment as much as we used to. This is true both in the variety of cloth that we use  and the appearance of each garment. We have developed a formula or set of rules that we apply to each new development  in order to ensure that the collection has internal logic and consistency. Going further and further down our own path in this way has been immensely satisfying.  I actually think the same is true here. I remember the subjects and photographs shared on here being more ""experimental"" four or five years ago  whereas now it seems to have mellowed somewhat. I don't see as many discussions of new or exotic designers as once I did. But I'm not a regular  so that's just an observation from comparing a few mental snapshots in time. There seem to be more practical discussions now — about what should be worn with what  and how to build a good wardrobe.

They're a step up from a T shirt  around the same level as OCBD. They come in long sleeve versions and short sleeve versions (although I think the long sleeve ones are ugly). As the name suggests they were obviously worn by polo players. Polos classically have a Pique knit style and are made of cotton but come in a variety of other fabrics. In some countries  polo shirts might be known as tennis/golf shirts and are made of a more technical fabric. Polos also have the wonderful reputation for being owned by frat guys who turn the collars up and spill various liquids all over them. All in all  they're quite prolific throughout the world  and make for a great warm weather option.

Post recommendations in response to a price bin  as a second level comment. You can also use top level comments for general info  inspo albums  and general questions. * Recommendations can be a brand (""I like Kiton suits!"") or a strategy (""I go thrifting for suits!""). * Try to stick to one brand/strategy per second-level comment. If you want to recommend both Alden and Carmina  post them separately so people can vote and discuss separately. * Include a **link** in your second-level comment if you can -- if not to a purchase page  at least to images. * Try to use prices you might realistically pay. That might be MSRP  or it might not -- it depends. If you're in a cheap bin  maybe the best buying strategy is to thrift  or wait for a big sale. If you're buying from a store like Banana Republic  paying full price is simply incorrect -- the only question is whether you'll get 40% off or 50% off.

I've also found great sales every once in awhile at Macy's (or Dillards as well for us in the south)  there's probably a science for it (end of season/month sales) but I just stop in whenever I'm near one and have scored deals like a BCBG dress for $8  originally $70.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.322727273,3351,

Good workwear.  I got a few really cute summer pieces from them last year when they were having a 50% off sale. * Loft - same.  Many sales  all the time.  Reasonable work clothes. * Topshop - has cigarette trousers for like $40 that can be washed many many times.  Be careful though  they run extremely small.  I know their US stores closed  but you can get a lot of their stuff at Nordstrom. * H&M - The sizing is all over and the materials are typically very cheap  but where else can you get dress pants for $15? * Nordstrom Rack - they always have at least a few racks of Calvin Klein or Tahari stuff that's clearly made for the Rack  but it will be modern  appropriate  and matching.  They are also  by far  the best for shoes.  Brands that I enjoy finding there: Cole Haan  Franco Sarto  Sam Edelman  Lucky Brand.  In general  I feel like pants help a lot to determine the formality of the outfit.  Dress pants will instantly make most outfits more professional-looking.  In the same way  jeans or jean-shaped pants will make anything look more casual.  Shoes too.  Adding loafers or oxfords to most outfits instantly make them more businessy.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.20152381,3352,

I've worked in very formal workplaces and I definitely couldn't find much that would work at some of the other suggested places. When I was at more formal places  my go-tos were Ann Taylor (shop the sales)  White House Black Market (again  sales)  Kohl's (surprisingly)  Marshall's  TJ Maxx  and thrift stores. And I got EVERYTHING tailored (OK  not everything - some of my shells  etc. were fine not being tailored  but all suiting pieces  including dresses).      Now that I'm in a place that kind of straddles the line between business casual and business professional  I find a lot at Old Navy  Target  and Loft  but none of those stores had much when I was in a truly formal setting - obviously  you'll be able to get a feel for your workplace!,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.197058824,3353,

Check out their waffle knit shirts (the sleeveless version is a tank I actually feel comfortable wearing to work)  extra fine merino sweaters and cardigans (the perfect v-neck cardigan IMO)  the 3D knit cocoon sweater  and the supima cotton button-downs.

Before my company switched to a jeans all the time dress code  this was one of my go to places for business casual pieces. You definitely have to watch for their sales and you have to realize that not everything they sell is going to be suited to your style. That said  I've gotten some great basics there.  Another solid choice is the Ann Taylor Loft outlet and the Ann Taylor Outlet. When these places have sales  you can get some really great deals on some awesome clothes.  Lastly  I found some solid business casual pieces at Target of all places. For example  I just got a pair of gray Ponte Knit black dress pants them for seven bucks on the clearance rack.

They're a step up from a T shirt  around the same level as OCBD. They come in long sleeve versions and short sleeve versions (although I think the long sleeve ones are ugly). As the name suggests they were obviously worn by polo players. Polos classically have a Pique knit style and are made of cotton but come in a variety of other fabrics. In some countries  polo shirts might be known as tennis/golf shirts and are made of a more technical fabric. Polos also have the wonderful reputation for being owned by frat guys who turn the collars up and spill various liquids all over them. All in all  they're quite prolific throughout the world  and make for a great warm weather option.

Post recommendations in response to a price bin  as a second level comment. You can also use top level comments for general info  inspo albums  and general questions. * Recommendations can be a brand (""I like Kiton suits!"") or a strategy (""I go thrifting for suits!""). * Try to stick to one brand/strategy per second-level comment. If you want to recommend both Alden and Carmina  post them separately so people can vote and discuss separately. * Include a **link** in your second-level comment if you can -- if not to a purchase page  at least to images. * Try to use prices you might realistically pay. That might be MSRP  or it might not -- it depends. If you're in a cheap bin  maybe the best buying strategy is to thrift  or wait for a big sale. If you're buying from a store like Banana Republic  paying full price is simply incorrect -- the only question is whether you'll get 40% off or 50% off. So factor that in. * The bins are in USD  so either use a US price  or convert a non-US price to USD to pick the bin.

They're a step up from a T shirt  around the same level as OCBD. They come in long sleeve versions and short sleeve versions (although I think the long sleeve ones are ugly). As the name suggests they were obviously worn by polo players. Polos classically have a Pique knit style and are made of cotton but come in a variety of other fabrics. In some countries  polo shirts might be known as tennis/golf shirts and are made of a more technical fabric. Polos also have the wonderful reputation for being owned by frat guys who turn the collars up and spill various liquids all over them. All in all  they're quite prolific throughout the world  and make for a great warm weather option.

They're a step up from a T shirt  around the same level as OCBD. They come in long sleeve versions and short sleeve versions (although I think the long sleeve ones are ugly).

In some countries  polo shirts might be known as tennis/golf shirts and are made of a more technical fabric. Polos also have the wonderful reputation for being owned by frat guys who turn the collars up and spill various liquids all over them.

It's the best hair conditioner that I've found yet and my skin likes it as well. From what I've read  it very closely matches the composition of your skin's natural sebum (J oil is technically a wax ester) which has in turn *reduced* my scalp's natural oil production. Frankly  it cured my seborrheic dermatitis. I use a small squirt of it and hot water to shave instead of shaving cream and it works great for me.  You can get a 4oz bottle of 100% organic jojoba oil on amazon for like $10 and that's enough to last me for months.   I also fill a smaller travel bottle and add a few choice essential oils and I'll use that as a natural fragrance.  So  yeah.

I think nursing is more competitive now than is was then so you probably want more than an associate's. If you want to work in public health a nursing degree should be fine. But if you want to be a nurse an MPH will be useless without also going to nursing school. I would def start with the nursing degree and only consider adding an MPH if you fund not having it is you back. As others gave said get the nursing degree if you want to do clinical work. If you want to be an epidemiologist you will probably want a PhD.  I have an MPH in epidemiology an very few jobs will accept that as enough.

My health commissioner is isn't even MPH  just someone who worked his way up from a sanitarian.  I think two are PhDs and one is an MD.  The only RN/LPNs on staff are in our clinical divisions (TB clinic  immunizations  etc) and our director of Harm Reduction.    None of the health educators that I work with are RN/LPN.  A few have some clinical backgrounds  but more actually come from either a science/research background or come from the enforcement side of public health (sanitarians for example).  Most are also an MPH.  I wonder if it's a regional thing?    Also  you certainly can get your RN and then get an MPH and have multiple career options available to you.  I just know that  watching my sister go through nursing school  if you don't want to be a nurse  nursing school would be really rough and not super useful unless you want a more clinical focus for your public health work.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.089565826,1783,
525,shshsnsahsjsj,[ADVICE] Nursing degree before an MPH?,I’ve been reading some of these posts and hearing that having a nursing degree helps tremendously with finding a job. Is there a specific sector of public health that is especially beneficial with a nursing degree?  I graduated undergrad a few years ago and I’m considering either an MPH and/or introductory Master of Nursing program that my state school offers.  I want to be a nurse  but I feel my calling is truly with public health - epidemiology and environmental health specifically. I’m wondering if it’s worth it to get a nursing degree and then go on to public health or skip it altogether and go straight into an MPH.

Back before my mom got her job  she was working as a regular nurse in a doctor's office. She's now over emergency preparedness/epi. You can tell they are squashed for resources because she covers 3 different jobs still.      She says that back then  (in the late 90's  early 00's) it was much easier to get a job in epi because no one really heard of it. It wasn't as big as it is now I feel.      There's no doubt that being a nurse has helped her. She was there for many outbreaks  hurricane Katrina  etc. There's just not as much funding anymore. After the hurricane  for example  they had loads to spend on disaster planning with local fire departments  airports.      She's done a bunch of stuff and I'm really jealous  but right now it's kinda flooded. I mean  every time I come on this subreddit  it's people wanting to get into epi about 80% of the time. I don't know much about it. I'm in health IT  which definitely needs at least a little clinical background. If I had gotten my nursing license  I would have a huge leg up. That's the thing about getting a nursing degree; it can be very fluid.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.053896104,1785,

Well  it was partially my fault because i didn’t fix my broken lamp seating and driving above the speed limit during a blackout (now that i say it out loud  it does sounds like i was being pretty dumb). Hit a speed bump and launched 3 yards into the dark night.  Hilariously enough  my first thought was; “man  if only i wore my stonewashed jeans. I’d have an authentic crash denim”  My second thought was making a good looking leather jacket with crash padding in the elbow  so i don’t have to experience my elbow being grated by the tarmac anymore.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.086979167,13730,

Hard to believe it's been two years since I've seen some of them.  &#x200B;  Last night  I had a great date at an Izakaya. Very spur of the moment but we agreed to have dinner yesterday. She was nice and we carried a great conversation but she wasn't much of a music/concert fan (big dealbreaker for me) and she didn't seem interesting from a hobbies perspective. Halfway through our dinner  someone who followed me on instagram told me how much of a fan he was of my fits. I was very surprised that that would happen and was of course very humbled by that! My date instantly thought I was an influencer and if I had a big following and I said ""nah it's the quality of the people I influence  not the quantity of people I influence"".",,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.218020833,13732,

When you're at a low point in your life  it's worth taking risks because  what do you have to lose?

I totally went through that graduation-breakup-living at home stuff last year and it fucking sucks. I graduate a semester behind everyone else and I felt so far behind (it was 6 months). It felt like everything was piling on and I went from feeling super comfortable and confident at college to floating a new environment. Everyone leaves and moves on and feels even lonelier.   The good news is  it’s the time when you learn the most about your self and develop a ton. A couple things helped me:  1.	Watch The Graduate. It’s a great film  it’s all about finding yourself after graduation. Plus it gets you watching new movies  that was the start of me really getting into movies and i had something to gush about and next thing I knew my remaining friends and I had a weekly movie night.  2.	Fucking grind  stay angry. Funnel it into getting a job and moving out. I’ve been angry for 2 years and it landed me 2 great jobs and finally my dream job.  3.	I love basketball. I don’t know if you play but go to the courts. There’s always dudes playing. People you didn’t talk to in high school. Guys who love the game. Get some anger out. Be awful. Get better. I learned more about life and myself learning to be an average pickup player than anywhere else and it made me so many friends. You end up group chats  you got guys to hang with it’s great.   It sucks dude  but remember life is a journey. You’re still young and everyone has a different path. It took me years to be accept I wasn’t late to life  everyone else was just early.

I really appreciate it.  I know how you feel about being behind everyone else. I essentially wasted two years at community college after I graduated high school. I failed a few classes and just sort of left after two years without getting a degree. I took a year off and went back to a different community college and did really really well. I got my associate's in Computer Graphic Arts and transferred to a University where I got my BA in Radio/TV/Film (I graduated summa cum laude which I’m very proud of). Being in classes with a bunch of 18 year olds at 24 feels super weird and seeing people that you graduated high school with having jobs and living on their own is a gut punch while you're still in college and living with your mom.   1. I love The Graduate! Considering my major  I was essentially forced to watch it. Funny enough  my ex got me a huge The Graduate poster as my grad gift. It's one of my favorite movies.  2. Fuck man  sometimes I wish I had the energy and motivation. The other day I felt a fire under my ass and went to a coffee shop and fired off like six applications. I think I need to try to transfer my depression and anxiety to anger  like you said.   3. I don't play basketball or any sports for that matter but that's good advice. I do have a gym membership (that I rarely use  go figure) and had like a two week span a couple of months ago where I was going to the gym like every other day and it felt great. But I think it really comes to having a hobby that makes me happy and engaged and introduces me to new people. The past couple of years  I took improv classes in my city. It was a fucking blast and I met a lot of people and felt such a rush performing in front of audiences. I even volunteered there last summer. I finished all the class levels and am eligible for team auditions  which is something for me to consider. Sadly  I didn't keep in touch with any of the friend I made there because I'm too nervous and intimidated and most of the people were like ten years older than me.   Seriously thank you so much for your advice.,,,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.076375689,13775,
